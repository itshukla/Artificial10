As a                  student an effective and good communication skill will bring confidence and help you to excel in all areas. No                  matter which language you choose, you need to be good in reading, writing and speaking skills. In this unit we will                  learn the different methods of communication which bring a positive impact in a student life.                            Communication                   The word 'Communication' is derived from the Latin word communicare, meaning 'to share'.                   The dictionary meaning of the term 'Communication', is the act of sharing or exchanging information, ideas or                  feelings.                   Wikipedia defines Communication as the act of conveying meanings from one entity or group to another through                  the use of mutually understood signs, symbols, and semiotic rules.                  Thus, Communication is defined as a process of exchange of information between two or more people by speaking,                  writing, signalling or using any other effective medium. Clear and concise communication is an important factor                  for meaningful interpretation of information.                   There are three important parts of Communication:                     • Transmission: The sender transmits the message to the receiver through a medium.                     • Listening: The receiver listens to the message and interprets it into meaningful information.                     • Feedback: The feedback of this meaningful information is conveyed back to the sender by the receiver to                    complete the communication cycle. Thus feedback is also known as receiver's response.                                                                                             Communication Skills-II  19","Learning Objectives of Effective Communication                 Effective communication skills help you deliver a clear and precise message without altering its actual meaning. It               is a very important skill that helps you develop strong relationships with the people around you in your school and               at home. Let us learn about main objectives of effective communication skills.               Development of Interpersonal Skills                 The skills which you use in your everyday life to communicate formally or informally with the people around you               as an individual or as a group are called interpersonal skills. These skills play a very important role in effective               communication. People with strong interpersonal skills build better and long-lasting relationships, both at home               and at work. They help you to communicate with other people under different circumstances.                Sending, Receiving and Understanding the Message or Information                Whether  verbal  or  non-verbal,  the  message  should  be  designed  well  by  the  sender.  The  receiver’s  job  is  to               understand  the message  in such a way that it matches with the intention of the sender. The receiver shares               responsibility with the sender to ensure an effective communication process.               To Express Effectively with Maximum Efficiency                 Avoid unnecessary words so that precise and meaningful information is delivered to the receiver. Facial expressions,               eye movement, body posture and gestures are quite effective non-verbal signals that lead to maximum efficiency               of effective communication.                          Communication Cycle                 Communication cycle is a process of sending and receiving of messages using verbal or non-verbal methods of               communication for meaningful interpretation of the message when it passes through a chain of recipients. The timing               and effectiveness of the communication cycle is based on how long it takes for feedback to be received by the initial               sender.               The main elements in the communication cycle are:                   • Sender: Sender is a person or entity who starts                 the communication process.  He will convey a                Feedback            Sender                 message with the purpose of passing meaningful                 information/ideas to others involved in the                 communication cycle.                                                                 Decoding                                 Ideas/Message                  • Message: It is the information which the sender                                                                                     Elements of                 wishes to convey to the receiver. It is the subject                                                                                  Communication                 with the actual content of the whole process of                 communication.                  • Encoding:  It is the process of converting the   Receiver                            Encoding                 message into a form in which only the intended                 receiver can understand by converting the actual                 Communication                                                                                     Channel                 message into symbols, words, actions, and                 diagrams.                  • Communication Channel: It is the media through which the sender passes the information to the receiver.                        20      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","• Receiver: An individual or a group receiving a message is called receiver.                     • Decoding: It is the interpretation of the message delivered by the sender.                      • Response/Feedback: It is the response given with respect to the message received by the receiver. Feedback                    can be positive or negative, delayed or immediate. It marks the completion of the communication process.                   For Example:                  Suppose, a Science teacher is teaching the Importance of an Ecosystem. So, the teacher is the sender; the students                  in the class are the receivers; the lesson on the Importance of an Ecosystem is the message.                  The teacher explaining the lesson using text, diagrams, symbols are the encoding components of the communication                  process. The digital presentation using white board is the communication channel to deliver the message. Students                  decode the message in their own ways and this can be checked through a feedback taken by the teacher in the                  form of a quick question and answer session before the class ends.

Choosing a right               method will help us in building a strong-relationship with the people around us in our professional and personal               lives. Some of the important methods of communication are verbal, non-verbal and visual communication. Let us               learn about them in detail.               Some of the important methods of communication are:                        ......     ......        • Face-to-face Informal Communication: It is the most popular form of verbal                                               communication where the transmission of messages occurs when the sender                                               and receiver are directly facing each other. Both of them can also observe and                                               adjust the communication by using proper gestures and body language. It is                                               the most effective form of communication as the inflation sent by the sender is                                               perceived directly with minimum distortion of the information. The sender also                                               gets the acknowledgement immediately.                       • E-mail: It is an easy and cost effective way of written communication where digital                 information can be sent instantly to one or more people in various locations.                                             • Notices/Posters: It is a form of visual communication generally used when the same                                        message is required to be conveyed to a large group of people. For example posters                                        help in publicising a given event like an annual day celebration in school, Diwali Fair etc,                                        a propaganda like “Say No To Plastic” , or even an artwork.                      • Business Meetings: It involves interactive and formal communication between two                 or more people where participants can engage in real-time discussions, share ideas,                 and exchange information.                                             • Other Methods: Some  other methods of communication can be using social                                        networking, messaging or making a phone call, through newsletter, blogs etc.                                         Choosing the right method of communication depends on                                         • target audience                                         • costs                                         • kind/type of information                                          • urgency/priority               The way you communicate directly affects how you are perceived and understood by others. Clear and effective               communication fosters positive  relationships, while poor communication can lead to misunderstandings and               strained connections. It is therefore crucial to invest ample time and carefully weigh various factors when deciding               on the most appropriate methods to enhance your effectiveness in tasks.                       22      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","Verbal Communication                   Verbal communication is the most popular form of communication where                  the transmission of messages occurs with the usage of words that can be                  in oral spoken or written form. It includes sounds, words, and speech. It                  is often used during presentations, video or teleconferences, informal or                  formal telephone calls, discussions, lectures, public speaking, meetings,                  etc. Verbal Communication can be divided further as:                     • Oral or Spoken Communication:  Communication which involves                    speaking. It can be face-to-face conversation or talking on a phone.                     • Written Communication: Communication which involves written or typed words. It can be writing letters,                    notes, email, etc.                  Thus, language plays a very important role in this form of communication. Speaking with clarity, being short, simple                  and focussed are important tools that will help in the process of verbal communication.  Verbal communication                  can be further classified into: interpersonal communication, written communication, small group communication                  and public communication.                                                     Interpersonal Communication                                                      Interpersonal communication is a one-to-one formal or informal                                                     conversation between two individuals. There are less chances of                                                     misinterpretation of information in this type of communication. For example:                                                        •  Conversation  between  teacher  and  parent  during  parent-teacher                                                        meeting.                                                        •  A teacher clearing a doubt of a student on a specific topic during recess                                                        time.                     •  Two friends working on a class project.                      • A telephonic conversation between two people.                   Written Communication                    In this type of communication words are written in the form of letters,                  circulars, reports, manuals, SMS, social media chats, school notes, projects                  etc. Vocabulary and grammar of any language used should be good to                  have effective communication. It can be between two or more people.                                                            Small Group Communication                                                        It is an interactive communication amongst a group of people like in Press                                                      conferences, Board meetings, Staff Meetings, Interactive sessions between                                                      teacher and students in a class etc. For example:                                                         • On the spot quiz based on the topic covered in a class.                                                         • An interview of a candidate with a panel of people.                                                          • Meeting of the principal with the teaching staff.                                                                                            Communication Skills-II  23","Public Communication                In this communication an individual addresses a big crowd. For example:                  • Students campaigning for annual student representative selection.                  • Annual day celebration in a school.                  • Interschool Debate competition.               Advantages of Verbal Communication                Some of the advantages of verbal communication are:                   • Clear and precise message is delivered to the receiver, so there are less chances of discrepancy in the delivered                 message.                  • The information conveyed can be saved for future use by recording the verbal or written communication.                  • The exchange of ideas and thoughts are straightforward, quick and saves a lot of time.                  • It gives instant feedback when the sender’s intended message is received properly by the receiver.                   • It is quite interactive and the scope of seeking clarification is greater in a less formal atmosphere.               Disadvantages of Verbal Communication                Some of the disadvantages of verbal communication are:                  • Language has different dialects or speech tone that lead it difficulty for the receiver to understand the message                 conveyed by the sender.                  • Lengthy messages (written or oral) are difficult to comprehend, unsuitable, and boring especially in a crowd.                  • As messages are delivered instantly, there is no scope for rectification of wrong words used in oral or written                 messages.                   • Great difficulty in communicating with people living in different time zones.                  • The emotions of the sender have a strong impact on the delivery of the message to the receiver. If a teacher is                 upset or angry or tired, then despite all good efforts of hiding her emotions, she will not be able to deliver her                 lectures effectively.                  • It works effectively only with the help of non-verbal  communication like gestures, visuals,  body language,                 otherwise alone it is incomplete form of communication.                  • Verbal communication can be really expensive if you need to communicate in a language that you are not                 familiar with. Either you have to hire a person who works as a translator or install a software for your digital                 communication.               Mastering Verbal Communication                Most of the students may be good in their verbal skills yet they face issues as they might not be comfortable in               speaking in front of a big crowd or may get nervous in their oral skills. If a student focuses on a certain area, then               it will help them master their verbal communication. Below are some points which will help them improve their               verbal communication.                                                    • Think about your topic.                                                    •  Think about the most effective ways to make your listeners understand                       Think Before You Speak                                                     the topic.                                                    • Write or note down whatever you plan to say.                                                     • Speak clearly, loudly and at moderate speed.                       Concise and Clear            • Be sure the information you want to share is to the point.                                                    • Do not repeat the same sentences.                      24      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","• Be confident.                         Confidence and Body                                                       • Maintain eye contact, stand straight and be attentive.                         Language                                                       • Be friendly.                   Non-Verbal Communication                   Non-verbal communication is defined as communication through physical and physiological cues without using                  spoken or written words. The information is transmitted using body language, touch, facial expressions, symbols,                  signals, etc. Most of our communication with the people around us throughout the day is non-verbal and most of                  the time we are not aware of it. It is helpful when trying to understand others’ thoughts and feelings.                   When you are not interested in what the teacher is teaching in the class, you start looking around, disturb the                  person sitting next to you, fiddle with a pen or paper and observe little things in the class. Without using words                  you are able to give the message to your teacher that lesson is very boring and you are not interested.”                   Non-Verbal communication can be further classified into: Facial Expressions, Body Language and Gestures, Eye                  Contact, Body Posture, Appearance, Personal Space and Proximity, Paralanguage, and Haptics. Let us discuss about                  them.                  Facial Expressions                   Facial  expressions  are  a  very  powerful  way  of  conveying                  different forms of feelings and emotions. For effective non-                  verbal  communication  you  should smile when  you  meet                  someone, match your expressions with your words and nod                  while  listening.  Being  aware  of  your  own  facial  expressions                  is very  important  in a professional environment.  In one of                  the  studies, it was  found  that  the  most trustworthy  facial                  expression involved a slight rise of the eyebrows and a slight                  smile. Six basic  facial  expressions are—anger,  fear,  happy,                  disgust, sad, and surprise.                  Body Language and Gestures                    Body language means position, gestures, and movement of the body to convey and interpret the attitude and                  feelings of a person. Positive body language can help you get what you want if you know how to use it, whereas                  negative  body language  can make you miss  out on opportunities  or  offend                  people you want to impress. One theory on the origin of human language is                  called “Gestural Theory”, which conveys that speech originated from gestures.                  Some of the common body languages and gestures are:                     • Arms or legs across the chest                      • Rubbing or moving hands around                     • Standing with your hands clasped behind your back                     • Playing with your hair or nose                     • Putting your head in your hands                                                                                               Communication Skills-II  25","Brainy Fact                       The first modern book on body language appeared more than 350 years ago.                  Eye Contact                Keeping a proper eye contact shows you are mentally present and actively involved in communication. The way you               look at someone will reflect some of the strongest emotions and feelings during a social conversation. Rolling your               eyes express displeasure or unhappiness with a situation.                Eye contact helps you:                  • Facilitate the connection with your audience in a meeting,                 conference, presentation, etc.                  • Improve your concentration                   • Give confidence and authority                  • Retain the important points of conversation                  • Express your emotions like sadness, happiness, surprise, fear, etc.                                           Body Posture                                           Body posture is the position of the human body and its alignment and orientation                                          with respect to non-verbal communication. During a conversation, the way you sit                                          or stand and communicate your body postures to the others depends a lot on your                                          attitude and emotional state. Before you start a conversation, standing straight and                                          holding your head high will have a great impact on the crowd.                                           The correct body postures for effective non-verbal communication are:                                              • Keep your shoulders straight and body relaxed                  • Sit straight while resting your hands and feet in a relaxed position                  • While standing, keep your hands by your sides               Appearance                 Appearance includes our choice of colour, body cleanliness, properly dressed, hairstyles,               etc. When you are speaking in public, you may be representing your organisation or just               yourself. You should ensure that you are properly and neatly dressed. It also increases               your self-confidence and you will definitely feel good about yourself.                                                    Personal Space and Proximity                                                    Personal Space refers to the appropriate distance during a conversation or                                                   space surrounding each person. Factors like regional culture, gender, age,                                                   ethnicity, or topic of conversation affects a personal distance.

This helps you understand the context and the meaning of the                  words used in the communication.                  A cold tone of voice might suggest that you are actually not fine and don't wish                  to discuss it. A bright and happy tone of voice will reveal that you are happy with                  the things going around in your life. Silence or vocal pauses can communicate                  hesitation, the need to gather thought or serve as a sign of respect.                                          Haptics                                          Haptics  is  the  power  of  touch  in  communication.  Each  touch  conveys  emotions  and                                         feelings in a physical form with a unique message like fear, disgust, love, encouragement,                                         gratitude, sympathy, anger, pain, violence etc. Studies have shown that it plays a very                                         important role in the proper development of babies and in animals it works as a sign of                                         love and care. You may begin your interaction with people by shaking hands and making                                         casual conversation. This interaction can help establish trust before you start addressing                                         your audience.                  Advantages of Non-Verbal Communication                   Some of the advantages of non-verbal communication are:                     • It is used as complimentary with verbal communication to enhance the effect of communication.                     • Information can be easily presented  in non-verbal  communication through  gesture,  body  language,  etc.  A                    teacher with a finger on the lips conveys not to talk and sit quietly to the whole class. A person addressing a                    crowd uses voice modulation to get the attention of the crowd. Sometimes nodding your head to say yes is                    enough to convey the message.                     • Using gestures, facial expressions, eye contact, touch, etc. can be very helpful for the illiterate and physically                    challenged, especially with hearing and speaking problems.                     • It is useful, fast and easy method of communication where no common language is required to master.                  Disadvantages of Non-Verbal Communication                   Some of the disadvantages of non-verbal communication are:                     • Since it uses gestures, facial expressions, eye contact, touch, signs, sound, etc. for communication, there are                    chances of misinterpretation of the message required to be delivered.                     • Different  cultures  use  different  ways  of  non-verbal  communication.  The  difference  in  message  can  lead  to                    negativity and offense. For example, people who speak less and are less interactive are considered cold and                    arrogant. However, the Japanese admire silence and consider it as a key to success.                     • Non-verbal communication does not follow any rules or structures, therefore people unconsciously may engage                    in non-verbal movements which are considered offensive.                      • It is not suitable for long and lengthy messages as the actual message may get lost in a lengthy and time-                    consuming conversation.                     • Sometimes it is an incomplete form of communication and needs a support of verbal communication for effective                    and meaningful delivery of a message. Distant communication is not possible using non-verbal communication.                   Visual Communication                   Visual Communication is the transmission and interpretation of information by using visual resources like photographs,                  videos, art, drawings, sketches, charts and graphs. Visuals enhance the process of communication during written or                  verbal communication for better understanding and a meaningful interpretation of the information.

To indicate ‘danger’               we use red colour sign, to indicate ‘no smoking’ we use an image showing a lighted cigarette with a cross mark               on it, etc.               Some of the common examples of visual communication in our day-to-day lives are:                                           Horn Prohibited                                     No Parking                                             Ladies and Gents Toilet                             No Left Turn                                            Pedestrian Crossing                                 Railway Crossing                                           Red light indicates Stop, Yellow                                       light indicates Wait and Green                      No Smoking                                       light indicates Go                                            Wifi                                                Under Construction                                             No Pets Allowed                                     No Entry                                             Danger Warning                                      Radiation/Biohazard Warning                                              Under CCTV Surveillance                             No Mobile Phones                  Advantages of Visual Communication                Some of the advantages of visual communication are:                  • It enhances the other forms of communication for better understanding of the information conveyed.                  • Sometimes it works as a better way of communication as it has been proven scientifically that pictures have                 more impact than spoken or written text. For example: for people who have difficulty in hearing and speaking,                 sign language is the most suitable way of communication. For instance a science  teacher uses a picture of a                 heart in science to explain the circulatory system.                      28      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","• When the content is lengthy and difficult to explain, then it can be easily handled through visuals in a shorter                    period of time.                     • There is no prerequisite of learning a specific language and can be used by people in different geographical                    areas with different cultures.                  Disadvantages of Visual Communication                   Some of the disadvantages of visual communication are:                     • It is an expensive medium of communication as it requires the additional cost and time for designing and                    printing pamphlets, posters, pictures etc.                      • It is a time-consuming process as designing and decorating takes more time than writing or conveying orally.                     • Visuals alone are not a complete way of delivering meaningful information. It needs other forms like verbal and                    non-verbal to complete its communication.                     • It is a specific skill which cannot be used everywhere and in all situations.                           Impact of Body Language                    Body  Language  is  a  very  important  part  of  non-verbal  communication  that  reveals  your  true  thoughts  and                  emotions. It includes gestures, body postures, movements and expressions to convey our message in a group or                  to an individual.                  Albert Mehrabian, Professor of Psychology at the University of California, did research on body language in the                  1950s and he found that the total impact of a message is about 7% verbal (words only) and 38% vocal (tone                  of voice, pauses and other sounds) and 55% non-verbal using body gestures, body postures, movements and                  expressions.                                                         7%                                                                                         Words                                               38%                 55%                  Body Language                                                                                         Tone of Voice                          The five main elements of the body language are:                     • Facial expression                      • Body movement and posture                     • Gestures                     • Eye contact                     • Touch                   Positive and right body language creates a sense of confidence                  and helps you gain the attention of your audience even if you                  need to fake it initially. Learning this skill allows you to make                  positive changes in your behaviour and this leads to better                  outcomes.                   Let us now study some of the do’s and don’ts for positive impact of body language on the people around us.                                                                                         Communication Skills-II  29","Do’s of Body Language                   • Be relaxed, calm and confident when you walk-in for starting a communication.                  • Keep smiling in between as it shows that the person is confident and trustworthy.                  • Stand or sit with a relaxed posture and straight spine.                   • Keep your arms open and by your side when not communicating.                  • Do hand shake, bow or namaste before you begin with the conversation.                  • Make eye contact occasionally to show your level of involvement.                  • Be a good listener and nod in between while listening.                  • A little movement is necessary if you are giving a presentation.                   • Place your feet firmly on the ground while moving during your presentation or addressing a gathering.                  • Give a positive facial expression and try to be natural with your gestures.                Don'ts of Body Language                   • Do not turn your back towards your audience.                  • Do not sit with your arms and legs crossed. It shows you are not interested in the conversation.                   • Do not be overconfident in your expressions and your tone.                  • Do not lean on the wall or any other object near you.                  • Do not lean forward or backward while sitting.                  • Do  not  fidget  with  the  objects  like  paper,  pen,  etc.  around  you.  It  shows  you  are  bored  and  avoiding  the                 conversation.                  • Do not roll your eyes around or stare.                   • Do not hold a book or anything in front to block the view.                         Feedback                 A communication cycle is incomplete and irrelevant without feedback. Feedback is a response of the receiver               with respect to the message received from the sender. It works as an indicator for the successful transmission               of the message thus making communication a two-way process. If there is no feedback, communication will be               incomplete and ineffective. Feedback is not only giving answers in the class but also sharing new ideas related to               the concept.               Feedback can be positive or negative. A good feedback is always:                  • specific                   • helpful                  • kind               Feedback completes the whole process of communication. A good feedback is one that is:                  • Clear and Specific: As general feedback and unwanted statements do not give a true picture of the effectiveness                 of the communication.                   • Timely: Sometimes, instant feedback is quite helpful and in some situations may be after a period of time. But                 feedback loses its importance if given at “inappropriate time”.                   • Polite: Offended language and tone should not be used.                  • Descriptive: Focus on what message the sender wants to convey rather than evaluating the message.                       30      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","• Authentic: A right form of response is important for giving genuine or authentic feedback to the sender.                     • Offering Continuous Support: The sender should be available for support if needed to achieve the desired                    result in the process of communication.                   For example, in a class after the explanation of a chapter is done by the teacher, she can take the feedback by                  asking questions like “Do you understand?” or “Do you have any doubts?” etc. At the same time, she must allow                  her students to express their views to complete this cycle of communication. This will help a teacher to evaluate                  the effectiveness of the lecture covered in the same terms as intended and planned by her.

In the above example, a smile would be a positive                  feedback to convey ”Yes, understood” whereas rolling your eyes and fidgeting with the objects around will indicate                  “not understood or not interested”. The teacher can also ask a question to know the status of the class and the                  feedback will be the answer conveyed orally or in written form.                   The process of giving a feedback should follow the given steps:                  1. The message should be clear, and interpreted properly by the receiver.                   2. If the message is not clear, then clarify from the sender by asking questions.                  3. Always refers to the original form of message to understand it clearly.                   4. Convey the response in the form of feedback to the sender.                  Importance of Feedback                    Feedback is the final component in the process of communication. The reason why feedback is important are given                  below:                     • It Validates Effective Listening: When someone gives feedback, it means they understood what was said to                    them. This understanding is important because it tells the speaker that their message was clear and meaningful.                     • It Motivates: When people receive positive feedback, it can lead to stronger work relationships, as people feel                    appreciated and are more likely to collaborate effectively.                     • It is Always There: Feedback is always present whenever we communicate with someone. Every time we speak,                    our words, tone, and body language all send messages back to the other person, whether we realise it or not.                    Even if we don't say anything directly in response, our reactions and expressions still provide feedback.                     • It Boosts Learning: When we get feedback, it shows us what we'r doing well and what we need to work on. This                    keeps us focused on our goals and helps us stay on track. By understanding what needs improvement, we can                    make better plans and decisions.                     • It Improves Performance:  When  we  receive  feedback,  it  highlights  what  we're  doing  right  and  what  needs                    improvement.  This  information  allows  us  to  make  smarter  choices  about  how  to  work  more  effectively.  By                    understanding our strengths and weaknesses, we can focus on areas that need development and continue doing                    things that work well.                                                                                         Communication Skills-II  31","Types of Feedback                There are different types of feedback given by the receiver depending on the type of information and the message               that needs to be conveyed. Each type of feedback has its own features. Let us learn about different types of               feedback in detail.                Specific and Non-Specific Feedback                Specific feedback focuses on the specific points of utmost importance and should be conveyed to the sender.               Following are the specific feedback given by a teacher to her students:                   • “The article you submitted for the school magazine is very well written and I like the way you portrayed the                 image of a girl child facing social injustice.”                   • “You have not done well this time in questions related to Profit and Loss in maths.”               Non-specific feedback is a general feedback that does not focus on any specific point. For example:                  • “The article you submitted for the school magazine is good.”                   • “You have not done well this time in exam.”               Positive and Negative Feedback                Positive feedback focuses on the sender's strengths, achievements or successes. It also takes care of the areas of               improvement and creates a positive attitude for the sender. For example:                  • “Nice work done by you.”                  • “You were really good on stage but if you work more on your voice modulation, then you can do wonders.”               Negative feedback highlights the weaknesses and problems of the information that the sender has conveyed to               the receiver. It should be genuine or true to bring a positive change in the process of communication. For example:                  • “You did not submit your assignment.”                  • “You wrote your answers very badly.”                  • Taking long time to reply email, SMS.                  • Not smiling at the time of meeting.                No Feedback                When the receiver does not respond with a feedback then it is called No Feedback. This will make communication               as one way process.                         Effective Communication                 Effective communication is a two-way process of exchanging ideas and information between the sender and the               receiver in such a way that the message sent by the sender is same as that received by the receiver.               Development of relationships, cultures, civilisations, etc. both at the micro and macro level depend on effective               communication. To make an effective communication:                   • Language of the message should be simple and clear                  • Message should be easy to understand                  • One should develop healthy relationship with others                  • The message should be close to its intended meaning                  • Receiver should ensure proper feedback                          32      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","Reboot                          1.

If any one of these is missing in your                  communication, then it may lead to either misinterpretation or incomplete information.                   Following are the 7Cs of communication:                         Clear                    Concise                   Concrete                  Correct                         Be clear about          Use simple words           Use exact words            Use correct                         what you want            (say only what is            and facts               spelling and                             to say                  needed)                                            grammar                                     Coherent                   Complete                   Courteous                                     Words should               Include all the            Be respectful,                                    make sense and                 needed                   friendly and                                      relate to the              information                  honest                                       main topic                   Clear                   The message intended to be delivered through communication should be clear and in understandable format.                  Clarity in writing or speaking of the message plays a very important role in effective communication.                  Concise                    The message must be conveyed by using only limited words. Avoid using fancy, unwanted or repetitive words or                  fillers otherwise the actual message intended to be conveyed may get lost in the long content.                  Concrete                   The content of the message  should  use only necessary words with complete facts and figures to avoid                  misinterpretation of the message by the receiver.                                                                                             Communication Skills-II  33","Correct                The message should be designed using the right level of language. There should be no spelling or grammatical               mistakes for effective communication. Facts and figures should be correct and relevant to the message.               Coherent                The words used should be relevant to the message intended to be sent. It should relate to the main topic of the               message and the content should flow logically.               Complete                 The  message should include all necessary  information  and  should be  complete in all respects  for  effective               communication.               Courteous                 The content of the message should be respectful, friendly and honest. The sender should not hurt the receiver               through the message and at the same time the feedback given by the receiver should not affect the feelings and               sentiments of the sender.                          Barriers to Effective Communication                 There can be many barriers to effective communication. Sometimes the sender may not be using precise words               and content, so the message delivered to the receiver may not be clear. Sometimes the message is misinterpreted               or the feedback given by the receiver is not appropriate, thus leading to a gap in communication. Let us now study               in detail the possible barriers to effective communication.                Physical Barrier                 Physical Barriers are due to geographical or environmental reasons. There are many factors in our surroundings               which hinder the smooth process of effective communication.                  • Sometimes the noise of the traffic, music playing around, some machines in a factory, Air Conditioner or cooler                 and other sounds may either interrupt the smooth delivery of the message or lose the interest of the receiver.                  • If the temperature of the surrounding is either too hot or too cold, then the working environment will not be                 comfortable.                   • Sometimes, different time zones will create problems in connectivity as one person may be in his working time                 zone and the other may be about to end his day or sleep or have dinner with his family.                  • Sometimes, long-distance communication using e-mail, fax, telephonic conversation may not be functioning                 properly due to bad weather or internet connectivity issues.                  • Working environment may not be comfortable due to unhealthy surroundings, poor infrastructure, untrained                 staff, etc. This also hinders the performance of the employees.                Linguistic Barrier                 The inability to communicate using a language is known as a language barrier to communication. This inability               may be due to lack of common language, inefficiency to use the language since it is not a mother tongue or               speaking disability.                  • An English person traveling to Japan will not be able to interact with Japanese if he doesn't know Japanese.                        34      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","• Sometimes,  people belonging  to different  places may be speaking the  same language  but  have  different                    pronunciation, dialect, meaning and interpretation which may lead to miscommunication, thus altering the                    overall process of communication.                     • Sometimes, a specific organisation or industry uses certain technical words or symbolic words or jargons and                    slangs which make it easy to communicate. If a new employee joins or is transferred to a new environment, then                    the efficiency of the whole process may reduce due to lack of knowledge of these words.                     • Some people may have language disabilities such as stuttering, dysphonia or hearing loss while others working                    with these people in an organisation may be spontaneous and grasp things easily which creates a lot of difficulty                    in communication.                                  Brainy Fact                         There  are  an  estimated  7,000  languages  in  the  world  today  with  Asia  holding  the  title  for  the  most                       languages in one continent with 2,200.                    Interpersonal Barrier                    Lack of will to communicate, social anxiety, poor self-esteem, not being willing to talk or express feelings will lead                  to interpersonal barriers to effective communication. The Change of thoughts, feelings, and emotional connection                  plays a major role to reduce this type of barrier in communication.                  Interpersonal barrier to communication process may be due to:                      • withdrawal or lack of being in touch for communication.                     • strict rituals of people living in certain geographical area.                     • more engaged in leisure activities that involve only self and not others.                     • poor self-esteem or social anxiety.                      • strict rules and regulations in certain working environments where the employees need to be less interactive                    and more formal.                   All these above factors will lose the interest of the people to communicate which might be either misinterpretation                  or incomplete communication of information.                  Organisational Barrier                    Inadequate  flow of information amongst employees  working at different levels  of hierarchy  may lead to                  organisational barriers. This may be due to:                     • the restricted rules and policies of an organisation as the employees avoid getting into the hassle of sending or                    receiving any message. For example, if the company rule says that all communication should be in writing, then                    even a small message where time constraint plays a very important role in decision making may lead to delay in                    the transmission due to writing formalities and level of approval required from different people.                      • a formal communication protocol is always followed when communication takes place between senior and                    his subordinate. In such situations, a subordinate employee will always have a fear, anxiety and withdrawal in                    communication.                      • absence of certain facilities like a comfortable working environment, telephone, fax or internet connectivity,                    suitable temperature, sufficient tools and healthy relationships with the co-worker may affect the efficiency of                    employees and hinder the process of communication.                                                                                          Communication Skills-II  35","• poor coordination amongst the employees due to the complex organisational structure will lead to filtering and                 misinterpretation of the information.                Cultural Barrier                Culture  is values and  principles followed  in the  lives of people living in society. It is the sharing  of customs,               rituals, beliefs, ideas, art, knowledge, values, morals, ideals, etc. amongst people living in their own geographically               restricted areas.                  • As mindset of people of different cultures are different, so is their language, signs and symbols. This causes a                 barrier to communication.                  • Culture also gives rise to prejudices and stereotypes. These become the societal norms, thus becoming a barrier                 to effective communication amongst people of different cultures.                  • Different cultures adopt different ways of communication. For example, some cultures may be very open while                 others may be orthodox, thus affecting ways people communicate among various cultural sects. For example, in                 Arab countries it is considered to be a social crime to greet an opposite gender by shaking hands.                         Ways to Overcome Barriers to Effective Communication                 Some of the important measures we should use to overcome barriers are listed below:                  • Use simple language.                  • Do not form assumptions on culture, religion or geography.                   • Try to communicate in person as much as possible.                  • Use visuals.                  • Take help of a translator to overcome differences in language.                  • Be respectful of other's opinions.                          Basic Writing Skills                Writing skills are the ability to use the language tools and knowledge in a most effective way into words that have               some meaningful form. Writing skills allow people to connect without physically being present in a room.               It is a part of verbal communication that  put your feelings and ideas on paper which can be in the form of letter,               report, email, notes, articles, SMS, chat, blogs, books, projects, etc.               Good writing skills will help you communicate your message with clarity to your audience. The usage of appropriate               words, grammar, punctuation, and spellings will decide how good you are in this skill.                         What is a Sentence?                 A sentence is a collection of well arranged words in a meaningful form. It is an essential part of any language which               helps you to express your thoughts, emotions in speaking and writing skills.               For example:  Nimisha is going to school.                            Sahil loves to sing songs.                            Sneha is very good at her studies.                Phrase is a group of words with no perfect meaning and may be a part of a sentence.               For example:  She went                            She sings                            I fell                     36      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","Rules for Writing a Sentence                      • It should have a meaning.                     • It begins with a capital letter.                     • It ends with a full stop, exclamation mark, or question mark depending on the type of a sentence.                     • It must contain one subject and one verb with an independent clause.                   Parts of a Sentence                    A sentence is made up of:                     • Subject: A subject is a noun that refers to a person, place or thing.                     • Verb: It is the action done by the subject.                      • Object: It is a person, place or thing that receives an action and gets affected.                             Subject       +           Verb           +         Object         =         Sentence                    For example:                  He drove a brand new car.

These are:                     • Direct Objects: Direct objects come after a verb and are directly ‘acted on’ by the verb. It answers the question                    \"what?\" or \"who?\". For example:                    She sang on Annual day.                    Peter doesn't like Maths.                                                                                        Communication Skills-II  37","• Indirect Objects: Indirect object is the recipient of the direct object. It answers the question \"to whom?\", \"for                 whom?\". For example:                 She made a cake for her mother’s birthday.                 He wrote a letter to his friend.                            Reboot                       Let us try finding direct and indirect objects in the given sentences.                     1.  The teacher gave answers to the students.                     2.  Meera made a beautiful painting.                     3.  Sneha doesn’t like pizza.                     4.  She is writing a poem                     5.  She bought his daughter a new dress.                   Types of Sentences                There are four types of sentences as explained below:                   • Declarative or Assertive Sentence: A sentence which gives information and marks a bold statement. It may                 state a fact. Most of the sentences of English language are declarative or assertive sentences. For example:                  I have a beautiful dress.                  My friend is an excellent badminton player.                  • Imperative Sentence: A sentence that makes a request or gives an order, an advice or a command. For example:                 Don’t spend too much time on the phone.                  Please help me with this work.                  • Interrogative Sentence: A sentence that asks a direct question and ends with a question mark (?) For example:                 Are you scared of dogs?                  How will you come to my birthday party?                  • Exclamatory Sentence: A sentence that shows an excitement or a strong feeling. It ends with an exclamation                 mark (!). For example:                 Wow! You won the badge.                  You dance so well. Congratulations!                Active and Passive Sentences                When the subject in the sentence has performed or received the action it becomes the voice of a verb in the               sentence.               In an active sentence the action is performed by the subject. It is a strong and direct way of expressing a sentence.               For example:                 Shweta is eating chocolate.                 In this example Shweta is a subject and the action is performed by her.                           38      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","Few more examples are:                    Rohin changed his phone cover.                    Neha stitched her new gown.                   In a passive sentence the action is received by the subject. In this form of a sentence  the focus is on the action                  and not on the subject. For example:                    The chocolate is eaten by Shweta.                    In this example chocolate is a subject and it receives an action eaten.                            Paragraph                    A paragraph is a collection of relevant sentences with a common theme. It begins with an introduction of a theme,                  followed by sentences describing a theme and ends with a statement supporting a common idea. For example:                    Water is an essential component of our life. With its scarcity all across the world it is becoming a threat to the                  existence of life on earth. With rising levels of pollution, water resources are being depleted rapidly. The entire                  Earth consists of 71% water, out of which only a small percentage is drinkable freshwater. It is therefore very                  essential to save water, to save lives.                  Some general rules for writing a paragraph are:                      • It begins on a new line.                     • The first line has an indentation.                     • It focuses on a main theme.                   Capitalisation                   Capitalisation means writing the first alphabet of a word in uppercase. In English grammar, we cannot decide on                  our own to write anything in capital. We follow the rules of capitalisation whenever we write anything. It gives                  emphasis on certain words used at different places.                  Some of the basic rules of capitalisation which we all should remember in our basic writing skills are listed below:                     • Beginning of a Sentence: It is marked by capitalising the first letter in a sentence. For example:                        w My computer class is very interesting.                       w We are going for a movie today.                     • Proper Nouns: Capitalise the first letter of a proper noun like name of a person, place or an organisation. For                    example:                       w New Delhi is the capital of India.                       w My friend Rohit loves to play cricket.                     • Days of Week, Months and Holidays: Always remember to capitalise the first letter of days of week like                    Sunday, Monday, etc., months like June, August, etc. and holidays/festivals like Republic Day, Diwali, etc. but not                    the seasons like winter, spring, summer, etc. Let us look at an example:                       w Every year Republic Day is celebrated in India on 26 January.                     • The Pronoun “I”: Pronoun \"I\" is a reference to yourself and should always be capitalised. For example:                        w Reema and I are going for a picnic.                       w I love to read books before I go to sleep.                     • Directions: The directions like North, South, etc. are written in capital only when they are referred to as locations.                    For example:                       w I am heading towards South.                                                                                         Communication Skills-II  39","• Titles that Appear Before Names: The titles like President, Principal, Mr., Captain, etc. that appear before                 names are written with the first letter in capital. For example:                    w Mr. Singh is a good man.                    w President Peter gave a wonderful speech.                Punctuation Marks                These are the symbols used to help the reader understand the proper meaning of a sentence and where to pause               or stop. Let us learn about some the punctuation marks in detail.               Full Stop or Period (.)                Full stop or period is used at the end of a sentence. We also use it to shorten a word to form an abbreviation. For               example: Mr. for Mister, Col. for Colonel.               Question Mark (?)                Question mark is used to mark the end of any question asked in a direct speech. For example:                  • How are you?                   • Why did you not call me again?               Exclamation Mark (!)                Exclamation mark is used in a sentence to strongly express a feeling of happiness, sorrow, love, surprise etc.               For Example:                  • Wow! Such a pretty dress.                  • Oh! You got hurt badly.               Comma (,)                Comma is used to mark a pause in a sentence.                Any list of items mentioned in a sentence are separated by a comma. For example:                  • I want a dress, shoes, watch and a box of chocolate for my birthday.               It is sometimes used to separate two adjectives in a sentence. For example:                  • I have a brown, fluffy golden retriever.                A sentence with the location specified has a city separated by a comma from the state. For example:                  • Mahatma Gandhi was born in Porbandar, Gujrat.                When somebody is addressed in a direct speech. For example:                  • Hi Swati, how is your job going on?               Apostrophe (‘)                Apostrophe can be used to indicate the omission of some letters in a word. For example:                  • I’m enjoying my friend’s company.                   • It’s very hot outside.               It is used to show the possession of a thing. For example:                  • Adrissa’s eyes are blue in colour.                            40      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","Brainy Fact                         There are 14 punctuation marks in English Grammar.                              Parts of Speech                    Collection of relevant and meaningful words following the rules of a language will form a sentence .Every word                  you use in a sentence has its own role to play. Every word has a specific function to play in a sentence to make it                  meaningful. It falls into different categories to play a different role in a sentence. These categories are called the                  Parts of Speech. It is important to learn these different parts of speech to understand the language well to help                  you construct good sentences for effective communication.

They are used to avoid the repetition of nouns so that the sentences are                  smoother and effective. For example:                  Words are:                     I, she, her, you, himself, some, we, you, each, who, which, that, mine, yours, his, her                  Pronoun in a Sentence:                     She likes to play in the sand on the seashore.

Verb in a Sentence:                  Shruti danced to celebrate my victory.                  She broke her leg in an accident.               Adverbs                 Adverb is a word that describes a verb, an adjective or another adverb. It also tells how an action was done.

There  are  different  types  of               conjunctions. Some conjunctions may be used to make a list while some may be used to connect thoughts, ideas               or actions. For example:               Words are:                 But, and, yet, neither, nor, either, or, for, whether               Conjunction in a Sentence:                  I bought a pen, pencil and ruler for my exams.

Grammatically they are not                  related in a sentence but express a relationship between a word and a phrase in a sentence. Sometimes they are                  followed by an exclamation mark(!). For example:                   Words are:                    Cheers, alas, eureka, great, gosh, goodbye, oh, ouch                  Interjection in a Sentence:                     Alas!

It is used before a noun to show whether it is specific or not. In English                  grammar there are three articles—A, An, The. Let us study about them in detail.                   Definite—The                   “The” is a definite article which is used before a noun that indicates something clear or obvious.                  For example:                     • The sun shines bright today.                      • Give me the book on the table.                  Indefinite—A, An                    ‘A’ and ‘An’ are indefinite articles which are used before a noun that are not specific or known before.                     • “A” is used before a word beginning with a consonant(alphabets other than vowels) sound.                    For example:  A book (it can be any book)                                  A game (it can be any game)                     • “An“ is used before a word that begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) sound.                     For example: An umbrella                             An hour                             An ice cream                   When No Articles are Used                      • For common/general things. For example:                    Fruits are good for health.                    Do not eat medicines without doctor’s prescription.                     • Before a country, continents, islands, mountains and lakes’ name. For example:                    I live in India.                    I love to go to Shimla in the summers.                     • Before a sport/games names. For example:                    I like swimming.

It works as an indicator to ensure a successful                     transmission of the message.                     • Formal Feedback follows a predefined format or blueprint to construct the structure of the feedback.                     • Descriptive feedback is a detailed analysis in written or oral communication that helps the learner understand strong                     and weak points.                     • Non-Descriptive feedback is written or oral communication that provides meaningful information but does not                     contain detailed analysis and description of the feedback.                     • Specific feedback focuses on the specific points of utmost importance and should be conveyed to the sender.

Important reasons for organisational barriers are:                     ●   As mindset of people of different cultures are different, so is their language, signs and symbols. This causes a barrier                        to communication.                     ●   Culture also gives rise to prejudices and stereotypes. These become the societal norms, thus becoming a barrier to                        effective communication amongst people of different cultures.                     ●   Different cultures adopt different ways of communication. For example, some cultures may be very open while                        others may be orthodox, thus affecting ways people communicate among various cultural sects. For example, in                        Arab countries it is considered to be a social crime to greet an opposite gender by shaking hands.                    9.

Explain the types of barrier in Communication.                  Ans.  The process of communication has multiple barriers. They are as follows:                     ●   Physical  Barrier:  This type of barrier  refers  to  the  interference  to  effective communication occurring  in the                        environment. It can be the distance between people, a noisy source near a telephone, poor lighting, bad health, and                        other such factors.                     ●   Psychological Barrier: This type of barrier in communication distracts the communicator or prevents them from                        paying attention to the message. Shrillness of voice, anxiety, mental fatigue, and pre-conceived notions are some                        examples of psychological barriers to effective communication.                     ●   Linguistic and Cultural Barriers: A language is the expression of the thoughts and experiences of people in terms of                        their cultural environment. Each major region has its own language and culture. Lack of knowledge about the local                        language and culture can become a limiting factor to effective communication.                     ●   Mechanical Barrier: This type of barrier is created by the channel or medium itself. Disturbances and interferences                        in the channel can prevent the flow of some of the elements of the message from reaching their destination                        smoothly.                      48      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","11.

Self-Management skill, also referred to as               self-control, is the ability to control one’s emotions, thoughts and behaviour effectively in different situations.                Some of the best examples of stress management in a student's life are:               •  Managing the submission of the science project on time.               •  Practicing in the evening for two hours for an inter-state Badminton tournament coming up.               •  Making a timetable to plan the hours of study for the upcoming final exams.               Self-management skills help you stay on track, and create a path of success for yourself. This skill teaches you               how to handle stressful situations in life. Even the employer’s nowadays strongly prefer people with good self-               management skills.               In this unit, you will be learning self-management skills, which will help you further enhance your employability               skills.               Following are some of the skills you must master to succeed in life:               •  Self-awareness: Pay attention to what people say about your strengths, and areas where you can improve. Also,                 take time to reflect on your daily interactions with others. Think about the situations you handled well, and those                 you could have managed better.               •  Responsibility: It means being accountable for your tasks and actions. It is crucial for personal growth. Taking                 responsibility shows that you are reliable and committed to improving yourself, even when things don’t go as                 planned. For instance, if a teacher gives you an assignment, make sure you take full responsibility for it. This                 means doing your best to complete it on time. If you can not finish it on time, you should inform the teacher                 about the delay, and work on fixing the issue.               •  Time Management: Time management is about organising your tasks effectively to make the most of your                 time. It is important to prioritise what needs to be done, focusing on the most important tasks first. This means                 identifying what is urgent, and what can wait.                       54      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","•  Adaptability: Adaptability is the ability to adjust to new situations, and changes. To be adaptable, it is important                    to keep yourself updated with the latest practices, and stay informed about new information.                            What is Stress?                   Stress can be defined as our emotional, mental, physical and social reaction,                  to any perceived demands, or threats. It triggers a fight or flight response                  to handle different situations in our lives. It can be due to illness, exam                  pressure, loss of job, fight with somebody, stage fear, public performance                  etc. The demands or threats are called stressors. Stressors are the reason                  for stress.                  Most of the time you feel:                  •  Stress of not getting good marks in exams.                  •  Stress of not being selected for inter school events.                  •  Stress of deadlines approaching and work not being completed.                  The experience and effect of stress vary from person to person. Some of the common signs of stress are:                  •  Lack of sleep                                    •  Loss of appetite                   •  Restlessness and anxiety                         •  Loss of interest and focus                  •  Frequent headaches                               •  Memory loss                  •  Frequent mood swings                             •  Social withdrawal or isolation                  We all face good stress and bad stress in our lives. Good stress, also known as “Eustress”, occurs when we are                  excited. Our heart beat faster, and we feel a rush of hormones in our body, but it is not dangerous for us. We also                  feel this good stress before a public performance, ride in water parks, or when the exam result is declared. This                  kind of stress keeps us lively and excited in life. So in the short term, stress can have a positive impact on us, and                  our behaviour.                  Eustress motivates us to achieve more, but when the duration of stress increases for a long time then, it takes the                  shape of bad stress, which may cause physical or mental health problems. Exam stress, for instance, is beneficial to                  you since, it helps you stay alert and study for the test; however, chronic stress can lead to health problems such as                  headaches, nausea, and fainting during the test. Thus, stress management is crucial to success in life.                           Stress Causing Agents                    Stress is inevitable in life. Since you can't avoid it, the only way to get rid of it is to work on the agents that cause                  stress:                  •  Mental: When you are unable to cope with the mental pressure, it causes mental stress. For example, you may                    face a situation when you are not prepared for a stage performance, etc.                  •  Physical: Issues related to the general well-being and health of an individual can lead to low self-esteem and cause                    stress.                  •  Social: Social stress often arises from navigating significant              Mental                    relationships and managing one’s social status. It can also                    stem from challenges in cultivating healthy connections with                    those around you.

Self-Management Skills-II  55","What is Stress Management?                  Stress Management is a method, or a technique used to make changes in your lifestyle, thoughts, and emotions               that help you relax your mind and body to minimise the effects of stress. If the stress is too much in life, then it               may lead to serious health issues, so effective stress management techniques can help you overcome these issues               and manage your long-term and short-term goals effectively.               To manage all types of stress in life remember the ABC of stress management, originally created by psychologist,               Dr. Albert Ellis. This technique helps you analyse the three aspects of a situation that causes stress:                                  A                                  B                                 C                            Adversity                           Beliefs                        Consequences                         Adversity or the stressful          Beliefs or the way you           Consequences of actions                              event.                     respond to the event.           and outcomes of the event.                  Whenever you face a stressful event, you respond to it by developing thoughts and beliefs about the situation.               These thoughts, which can be negative or positive, will lead to different consequences. So, it is in your hands to               handle a stressful situation by controlling your thoughts, which will control your reaction that will affect you and               the people around you.

Step 2     Figure Out the Root Cause of Stress: Once you are aware of your stress, in this step you find out the                          root causes of your stress. It can be due to exam pressure, fighting with somebody close, the illness of                          a person close to you, not being selected for some competition, etc.                 Step 3     Adapt Stress Management Techniques: After identifying the root causes of stress, in this step, you                          focus on the important tools for managing your stress.

Every person is blessed with some ability that gives them the power to exist independently. Some                  can sing well, others are good at sports, some are good in logic and mathematics, and some may become good                  actors. Everyone is special in their own ways.                   To realise your own abilities, it is important to work independently. Try to do the assigned task independently                  by utilising all your abilities and work with your maximum productivity to accomplish the given task with great                  success. Working Independently means:                  •  You take ownership of the work.                  •  You become self-aware of your strengths, and weaknesses.                  •  You learn to monitor your skills, which if needed, can be self-corrected.                  •  You know the objective of the task assigned.                  •  You take the initiative rather than waiting to be told by others.                  •  You are sure of your skills to do the work without any supervision.                  •  You use the best of your abilities to complete the assigned task in stipulated time, and with intended objective.                  •  You are aware of your working pace and utilising it effectively.                   •  You take the ownership of your mistakes without looking for excuses.                  •  You have no scope for doubting your abilities.                  •  You have the ability and the will to learn continuously.                  •  You do not let your past experience affect your present assigned task.                  Advantages of Working Independently                    Some of the advantages of working independently are:                  •  Increased Focus: Since you are accountable for your work without any supervision, there are less chances of                    competition and outside distractions.

Know Yourself                    You might choose to do things that society wants you to do. Sometimes you indulge in an activity just to make                  your family happy without even thinking whether you want it or not.                   Knowing your strengths, weaknesses, values, interests, skills, and abilities will help you transform your thoughts,                  feelings and actions into a life full of peace and happiness. It is very important to learn about your true self, and                  identify the qualities that make you unique.                   The answer to the most important question, “Who am I” will help you identify your true self. This can be done by                  finding out about:                  •  Your beliefs, that control your thoughts and feelings.                  •  Your background and past experience, that shape your decision in future.                  •  Your opinions about yourself, that will shape your personality, and will give you clarity and understanding about                    your life.                  •  Your likes and dislikes, that will help you prioritise your activities, and will keep you emotionally healthy.                  •  Your values that persuade your choices you make in life.

Self-Motivation                  Self-motivation is the force that drives you to do things to achieve your goals. It is a life skill that must be necessarily               developed, to keep you going even in times of setbacks and look for new opportunities in every move of life.                Self-motivation helps you:               •  Push yourself to face the challenges of life.               •  Survive the tough competition in personal and professional life.               •  By giving you happiness.               •  By improving your quality of life.               •  To withstand setbacks, and grow as an individual.               •  To believe in yourself and convince yourself to do things as and when                 put to you.               For example, Shristi wakes up at 4 am in the morning to practice for badminton. Her father takes her for coaching               in the morning from 4 to 6:30 am, then from there she changes for school, and reaches school at 7:30 am. After               school, she goes straight home and has no outings with friends as she has to do her homework and cope up with               her studies. Also, eating healthy food and sleeping on time will help her wake up on her own early in the morning               for practice. Nobody tells her to do this, she does it on her own, and her self-motivation keeps her going to fulfil               her dreams to be an international badminton player one day.                Types of Motivation                It is important to understand that we all are different and our motivational needs vary from person to person.               There are two broad categories of motivation. Let us learn about them.                      62      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","Internal/Intrinsic Motivation                  Intrinsic motivation is related to what we want to do. It is doing something with fun which makes you happy, and                  is totally interesting for you. It gives you pleasure, and good feeling. For example, doing gardening, taking part in                  inter school debate, going for a morning walk, playing with the kids in the park, and doing painting in your free                  time.                  External/Extrinsic Motivation                  Extrinsic motivation is related to what we have to do. It is, doing  something that gives you rewards, or avoids                  getting punishments. The reward can be money, post, marks, goodwill, etc. For example, doing a part time job to                  earn money, going everyday for coaching to clear an upcoming competitive exam with good results.                   Qualities of Self-Motivated People                   Self-motivation is an essential tool that makes you do something, not because someone told you to do it, but                  because you wanted to do it to achieve the goals of your life. A self-motivated person should possess the given                  qualities to succeed in life:                  •  They know what they want from life.                  •  They are quite focussed to working hard to achieve their dreams.                  •  They know what is important for them.                  •  They are totally dedicated to fulfill their dreams.                  The four steps of building self-motivation are:                   •  Find Your Strengths: Understanding who you are, and finding your strengths will help you build confidence.                    Find your likes and dislikes. Find out what makes you happy.                  •  For example:                       w You love doing painting in your free time.                       w You enjoy taking part in extempore.                       w You love to go out with your friends.                  •  Set and Focus on Your Goals: Consider what you want to achieve, set that as your goal, be focused with all your                    energy and hard work to achieve your goal. For example, my goal is to become a doctor.                  •  Develop a Plan to Achieve Your Goals: With a plan you have a clear picture of how to get where you want to                    go, what it will take to get there, and how you’ll find the motivation to keep driving forward. So, planning a list                    of activities and setting timelines to achieve your goals is very important. For example, to become a doctor, I                    have to study hard and get good grades. Also, after school, attend coaching to clear my competitive exams to                    get into medical college.                  •  Stay Loyal to Your Goals: Hard work and constant dedication will help you stay loyal to your goals. Work                    towards achieving your goal, even when you are facing difficult time.                      Achieving something never comes easy and requires a lot of struggle to make it to the milestone. For example,                    if I don't clear my entrance, I will try again next year with full dedication and hard work because I have to fulfil                    my dream of becoming a doctor.                            Self-Regulation                    Self-regulation is the ability to keep your emotions and your behaviour in check and think reasonably before                  putting them into action. It leads to responsible and value-driven behaviour by keeping in mind the long-term                  consequences of your uncontrolled behaviour. It has been proven through research that self-regulation in children                  works as an important predictor of their academic abilities.

SMART Goals                 SMART goals are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound objectives. They provide clear direction,               and milestones to track progress. For example, “I will read one new book each month for the next six months to               improve my vocabulary and comprehension skills.” Let us learn more about goal and goal settings.                What is a Goal and Goal Settings?                Goals are the desire to achieve your targets within a given deadline. It is fulfilling your dreams within a finite time.               For example: Walking everyday to school to save money to pay for the picnic planned next month.               Goal setting is the process of identifying your dreams and then planning and implementing your methods, and               strategies to fulfil them. Goal settings provide you with a target and help you focus on what’s really important to               you, which will make you successful in your career and personal life.                How to Set SMART Goals?                The best way to set up your long term and short term goals in life is to use SMART methods where each letter stands               for:               •  Specific: Your goal should be clear, and well defined to help you focus on what you want in life. For example:                 “I want to become a School Student Head”.                  “I want to clear my medical entrance in one attempt”.                 “I want to be in national cricket team”.               •  Measurable:  Measure the progress of your goal both in                 terms of quality and quantity. Setup milestones to achieve                 your goal. For example, to clear medical entrance, passing the                                   T                 test series conducted weekly with good grades is important.

S               •  Achievable: Focusing on short-term  goals to achieve                 long-term goals will make them achievable For example,                 playing  cricket  at  school level, then  interschool,  state,  and                 interzones will help you to make a position in the national                 cricket team.               •  Realistic: Goal should be realistic and should be within your reach. For example, waking up early in the morning                 and practising for two hours everyday to improve the skills of playing cricket will be a realistic approach to win                 the match at different levels.               •  Time Bound: Goals should be time bound with a start date and an end date, otherwise, they lose their importance.                 For example, Winning matches at different levels in initial years of life will help.                      64      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","Time Management and Its Importance                    Time Management is the ability to utilise your time effectively so that you are able to do the required task at an                  appropriate time.

Computer System                 A computer is an electronic device designed to take input from the user, process it and then return the desired               output.  A  computer  system  is a  combination  of  hardware  and  software  components  that  help  in doing  the               required task.                The physical components of the computer which you can touch and feel are called Hardware. Examples are               mouse, keyboard, monitor, printer, etc.                A set of instructions given to the computer to perform specific tasks is called Software. Computer is of no use               without software. There are three types of software: system software, application software and utility software. Let               us learn about them.               Mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, function as complete computer systems with both hardware               and  software  components.  They  are  more  compact  and  portable  than  traditional  computers,  making them               convenient to carry and use on the go.                        72      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","System Software                   System software is a software which is compulsory for the computer.

These are set of keys on a computer keyboard that perform specific               functions within software applications and the operating system. Their functions differ from program to program.               For example: F1key in most programs is to get help on that program.               Some important functions performed by some of the keys are:               •  Control Keys: These keys such as Control (CTRL),  SHIFT, SPACEBAR, ALT, CAPS LOCK and  TAB are  used in                 combination  with  other  keys to  perform  specific functions  related  to  the  operating  system or  software                 applications.               •  Enter Key: The Enter key, also known as the Return key, is a fundamental key on a computer keyboard. Its                 primary purpose is to execute a command or to move the cursor to the next line in a text document.               •  Punctuation Keys: The Punctuation keys include keys for punctuation marks, such as colon (:), semicolon (;),                 question mark (?), single quotation marks (‘ ’), and double quotation marks (“ ”) are essential for proper grammar,                 syntax, and communication in written language.               •  Navigation Keys: These keys allows you to move the cursor or navigate through text and documents. They are                 essential for editing, selecting, and moving within different software applications. Arrow Keys (Up, Down, Left,                 Right) allows you to move the cursor or highlight text in the corresponding direction. The Home key moves the                 cursor to the beginning of a line of text or at the starting of a document. The End key moves the cursor to the                 end of a line of text or at the end of a document. The Page Up key scrolls up one page at a time in a document                 or on a webpage. The Page Down key scrolls down one page at a time in a document or on a webpage.                •  Command  Keys: Command keys, such as INSERT (INS), DELETE (DEL),  and BACKSPACE, execute specific                 commands or functions within an application or the operating system.. When the INSERT key is turned ON, it                 helps you overwrite characters to the right of the cursor. The DELETE key and the BACKSPACE key are used to                 remove typed text, characters and other objects on the right and left side of the cursor respectively.               •  Windows Key: It is often denoted by the Windows logo (  ), and is found on Windows-compatible keyboards.

Windows 11 is designed to make the mouse easier to use. Let us now see how                  useful this pointing device is in Windows 11.                   Single-click                                                                                                           click                  This is  the most common task performed  by a mouse in Windows 11. We can select a                  program, file, folder, menu, sub-menu, option, etc. using a single left mouse click. Whichever                  option is to be selected, move the mouse pointer to point to that area and do a single left                  mouse click to select that option.                     click                   click                                    Double-click                                     When we use the left button to click twice in quick succession, then, it is called a double click.                                    We generally use double click to open a file/folder, to open a specific program or application                                    software.                       Right-click                                                                                         click                   To display context based pop-up menu or shortcut menu, we use the right mouse button click.                  For example right clicking on a cell in a spreadsheet gives you important formatting features of                  the cell.                                            release                    press     move                   Drag and Drop                                                         Drag and Drop is used to shift the location of a file, folder or a program.                                                      We select an object and press the left button down. Without releasing the                                                      mouse button, drag the object to a new location and release the mouse                                                      button to drop it onto a new location.                     Hovering                   Hovering means moving the cursor over an option or an object without clicking it. This action can trigger certain                  responses from the operating system or software applications, such as displaying tooltips, changing the cursor                  shape, or highlighting the element.                           Performing Basic File Operations                     In a school or office, each teacher has a dedicated cabinet where they organise files for different students or                  classes on  individual shelves.  Similarly, a  computer  stores  information  in  electronic  files, which  are  organised                  into separate folders. Managing these electronic files is much easier, as they can be effortlessly copied, moved,                  renamed, or deleted.                                                                    Information \& Communication Technology Skills-II  79","What is a File?                Any data in the computer is stored in the form of a file. Different types of files store different types of information.               That is why a file is said to be a collection of logically related data. Every file has its own unique name which is               made up of two parts: file name (A filename can consist of letters, numbers, spaces, and characters) and file name               extension (that identifies the file type). They both are separated by period (.). For example:                  Mynotes.docx       →    is a Word file.              Essay.odf          →    is an LibreOffice document.                  Myproject.pptx     →    is a PowerPoint file.        Photo.jpg          →    is an image file.                   Myfriendslist.xlsx  →   is a Spreadsheet.            Music.mp3          →    is a sound file.                What is a Folder?                 Folder is a collection of related files and subfolders. A sub-folder may contain one or more files and subfolders               within. Folders do not occupy any disk space. They point to specific file locations within the file system of the               computer. There is no limit on the number of folders or subfolders that can be created in Windows. The main               advantage of creating folders and subfolders is that it helps in organising the data found in the system in a proper               hierarchical manner.                Creating and Managing Files and Folders                 Since folders  and  subfolders are  organised  following  a  proper  hierarchical  file system of  any  storage  device,               sometimes they are also called directories or subdirectories .The first directory in the hierarchical system is called               root directory and is represented as C:\\ or D:\\.               The folders and files are created within the root directory. To access any file, folder or subfolder we refer to a File               Path which allows quick access to a file.                For example the folder created within root directory for arranging files of different subjects in my computer are:                                                                      C:\\                                                                    Class X                                           English                  Computer                    Maths                                       Reader    Grammar    Computational     AI     IT        Geometry                                                             Skills               Creating a Folder                Perform the following steps to create a folder:                 Step 1    Click on the File Explorer icon present at the taskbar.

Only 12.5% of e-waste is                     currently recycled.                          Computer Security and Privacy                 Computer security and privacy is about measures we can take to protect your computer, personal information, and               online activities from unauthorized access, cyber threats, and privacy breaches. For example To access your online               banking account, you use a combination of a strong password and a two-factor authentication (2FA) method, such               as receiving a verification code on your mobile device. In another example of a Health Information Management               System, used by healthcare providers, employs strict access controls. Only authorised personnel with unique login               credentials can access patient records.               Reasons for Security Break                 Security break refers to the unauthorised access of sensitive information stored in a computer. Personal information               can be lost or leaked in two ways:               •  We are not careful in giving out personal information over the Internet. For example, we share our account                 details and passwords on unsecure sites.               •  A person gets unauthorised access to our computer. This can happen in the office if we leave the computer                 without logging out.               Threats to Computer                 Threats refers to the potential risk or dangers in which personal information can be leaked from a computer               without our knowledge.               Some of the common threats to the computer are:                (a)   Theft: Theft means stealing of information or sensitive or confidential data stored on a computer. These maybe                   of three types:                      • Physical: Where a person may steal your desktop computer or laptop.                      • Identity: Where a hacker steals your personal information and assumes your identity. Using this false identity,                     the hacker can gain access to your account information or perform illegal activity.                      • Software Piracy: This is stealing of software and includes using or distributing unlicensed and unauthorised                     copies of a computer program or software.                (b)   Virus: Computer virus is a malicious code that attaches itself to a file and enters your computer system and                   makes copies of itself and carries out the harmful tasks in such a way that it damages the important files of                   an operating system or application programs or important data files due to which the computer may stop                   working.                    Major types of viruses are Worms and Trojan Horse.                      • Worms: Computer worms are a type of malicious software or malware that can replicate and spread on their                     own mainly across computer networks.                       • Trojan Horse: This malicious software disguises itself as a useful software but is designed to carry out harmful                     activities on a computer. The name \"Trojan Horse\" comes from the ancient Greek story of the wooden horse                     used to infiltrate the city of Troy.                      88      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","(c)   Online Predator: Online predators are individuals who use the internet to exploit, manipulate, or abuse                     others, particularly targeting vulnerable populations like children and teenagers. They often build trust                     with their victims through flattery, gifts, or attention. They may pose as peers or friends to create a sense                     of familiarity and trust.                  (d)   Internet Scams: Internet scams often involve attractive offers that claim you have won a large sum of money                     in a lottery or a prize and that you can claim the prize by depositing a certain amount of money. When you                     deposit the money using credit card or online banking, you not only lose the deposit money but your card /                     account information may be misused later.                   Protecting Your Data                    Data protection is safeguarding your data from data damage or data access by unauthorised people. It is always a                  good practice to maintain and protect your computers data by following some precautions and managing a few                  computer settings.                                            Some of the important points to protect your data are:                     • Use Proper Passwords Combinations for Your Computer Login:  At the time to allocate passwords take care to use                    the combinations of small letters, upper case, numbers, and special characters like $, %, \&, etc. These combinations                    are difficult to hack and will be able to save your computer from unauthorised access.                      • Install Anti-virus and Firewall: Anti-viruses and Firewall will not allow the unwanted data to enter your computer.                    If by mistake you download any malicious code then antivirus or antimalware software will warn you and then                    will remove it from your computer. This way you will be able to project your data from getting damaged or stolen.                    Firewall can be a hardware— network security device or a software that acts as a barrier to protect your computer                    or a network of computers of an organisation from unauthorised access of data.                      • Encrypt Data:  Data  encryption  is  converting  the  readable  data  into  unreadable  encoded  form  to  save  it  from                    unauthorised access. Sometimes sensitive data like personal credit card transactions you do in online purchasing or                    data from defence services need to be transmitted through the internet or any other network should be encoded                    to protect the information.                      • Secure Sites: Websites that you access should be secured websites to avoid data hacking specially when you do                    online transactions using your bank details or credit cards. If the site address starts with https:// and a lock symbol,                    then it is safe to access.

Computer virus is a malicious code that attaches itself to a file and enters your computer system and makes copies               of itself and carries out the harmful tasks in such a way that it damages the important files of an operating system               or application programs or important data files  due to which the computer may stop working.               There are various types of virus. Some of them are:                •  Program File Virus: A program file virus, also known as file-infecting virus is a type of computer virus that infects                 executable files (program files such as .exe, .com, .sys, etc. files) to make them unusable or damage permanently.               •  Boot Sector Virus: Boot sector virus is one of the most hostile types of computer viruses that infects the boot                 sector or the Master Boot Record (MBR) of hard disks or floppy disks.               •  Macro Virus: A macro virus is a type of computer virus that is primarily designed to infect a specific type of                 documents such as Word or Excel files.               •  E-mail Virus: E-mail virus is a type of computer virus that transmit from one computer to other through e-mail                 messages.               Some of the viruses are designed to get activated at a certain date and time. No matter how advanced an anti-virus               software program you have installed in your computer the new malicious code will still find its way through your               computer defence system. They gain access to your computer through:                Infected files               •  Infected pen drives, CD/DVD-ROMs               •  Through infected file attachment of emails               •  Insecure websites               •  Online games               You will  come to know  about the virus that infected your computer through the following  common               symptoms:                •  Computer runs very slow as it loses its processing speed.               •  There will be a change in the system file size.               •  An unusual increase in number of files.               •  Computer restarts on its own in between.                •  Disk drives or disks become inaccessible.               •  An application or applications are not working correctly.               •  The computer locks up frequently or stops responding.               •  Dialogue boxes and menus sometimes appear to be distorted.               •  An anti-virus program will either be disabled or does not run properly.                A virus can:               •  damage or delete your system files, application program files or data files.                •  may reformatting your computer’s hard drive.               •  slow down the performance of your computer.               •  computer programs and applications may behave unexpectedly.               •  steal some important and confidential information like your name, credit card details, and other sensitive                 information kept on your computer and had over to unauthorised person.                      90      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","There are few important things which a computer virus cannot do. They are:                  •  It cannot infect files on CD-ROM as they are write-protected.                  •  It cannot infect computer hardware such as monitors, keyboard, mouse, printer etc.                   You can protect your computer from virus by following the given precautions:                  •  Install and use anti-virus software.                  •  Keep anti-virus software updated so that it can scan and remove new viruses.                  •  Scan all the files that you download from the Internet.                   •  Do not open e-mails from an unknown person/sender.                  •  Don’t allow any untrustworthy person to use your system.                  •  Never use unknown pen drive/CD on your computer.                  •  Never click on the unknown windows that pop-up when you are surfing the Internet.                                  Brainy Fact                         The Creeper virus is the first computer virus  designed by Bob Thomas in 1971 as he conducted an                       experiment to develop a self-replicated program.                   Scanning and Cleaning Virus                    Scanning and cleaning a virus prevents any viruses from entering and will also clean any viruses that may have                  entered your computer system unknowingly. Install Anti-virus or anti malware software to keep your system safe.                  Anti-virus software is a program designed to prevent,detect and remove malicious programs from the computer.                  After you install the anti-virus software runs automatically in the background to provide real-time protection                  against virus attacks. You should also  run full system scans periodically. Some examples of anti-virus software are                  McAfee Virus Scan, Norton Anti-Virus, Microsoft Security essentials, Quick Heal etc.                  Windows Defender Firewall is an antivirus software that's included in the Windows operating system that protects your                  device from viruses and other malware and threats. To enable Microsoft Windows Defender Firewall on Windows 11:                   Step 1   Select Start and open Settings.                  Step 2   Go to Privacy \& Security, then Windows Security--> Firewall \& network protection.                   Step 3   Choose a network profile: Domain, Private, or Public.                   Step 4   Switch the Microsoft Defender Firewall setting to On.                   If you need to disable it, switch the setting to Off. Disabling the firewall can increase vulnerability, so it's better to                  allow specific apps through the firewall rather than turning it off completely.                   Some of the commonly used antivirus software are given below:                                  Quick Heal            Avira               McAfee              Norton                 AVG                                                                   Information \& Communication Technology Skills-II  91","What are Temporary Files?                 Temporary files are created temporarily by programs that store information related to the file you are working on               in your computer. It  increases the efficiency of  the software and also helps in recovering the data at the time of                unexpected closing of the file due to power failure or system shut down.                Temporary files are deleted automatically when the task or program you have been working on is completed.               If all the programs in a computer are closed and temporary files still exist then look for files with the extension               .tmp in the folder TEMP. They are of no use and they block a lot of disk space. It is better to delete them as they               hinder the performance of your computer. If the deleted temporary file is required by the program again then it is                automatically recreated without affecting your programs.                To remove temporary files in a computer follow the given steps:                 Step 1    Press the Windows (  ) key.                Step 2    Type Disk Cleanup and press Enter.

They are responsible for managing their operations, finances, and work schedule independently. An               individual who constantly strives to improve their business by taking risks and exploring new ideas is an entrepreneur.               For example, freelancers, consultants, small business owners, artists, and independent professionals.                Entrepreneurs operate their businesses within a marketplace where individuals buy and sell products and services.               This exchange benefits everyone involved as it generates income for all participants. In this way, entrepreneurs               contribute to the growth of their community and society. In the market, people buy products and services created               by an entrepreneur. The money which an entrepreneur gets is used to buy raw material, pay salaries and invest in the               business. This process of money circulation is helping all in the society. Society and entrepreneurship are intricately               connected, each influencing and shaping the other in significant ways.                Entrepreneurship brings some positive impacts on society as listed below:               •  They help in the economic growth of the country by boosting national income and tax revenue.               •  Identifying existing opportunities in the market with new and improved products.               •  Creates jobs and employment opportunities.               •  They do business in a creative manner and help in raising the standard of the society.                •  They provide developed infrastructure in the locality, improved network and good transport facility.               •  They help in community projects and support local charities that contribute to the welfare of the society.

Some of these are:                •  Helps in providing the raw material for the business.               •  Provides financial support through loans, shares, debentures etc.               •  Provides policies and laws in favour of promoting entrepreneurship.               •  Supports infrastructure development and network development.               •  Provides a market with the needs and demands of the product.               •  Creates a need for education and awareness for entrepreneurship.                          Customers' Needs, Wants and Demands                 Entrepreneurs fulfil customer's needs, wants, and demands by identifying them and taking necessary actions. They               can be understood as follows:                •  Needs: Identifying and providing essential products or services that solve fundamental problems or fulfil basic                 requirements.               •  Wants: Offering products or services that enhance the customer's lifestyle, going beyond basic needs to cater                 to their preferences and desires.               •  Demands: Understanding and responding to the specific expectations and buying power of their target market,                 ensuring they deliver value that meets or exceeds customer expectations.                For example, Maya is an innovative entrepreneur, she launched a line of nutritious healthy snack bars to meet               the basic needs of health-conscious individuals. Seeing a demand for variety, she introduced unique flavours that               catered to their wants. Listening to customer feedback, she also developed gluten-free options to meet specific               dietary demands. Through her keen understanding of customer needs, wants, and demands, Maya's business               flourished, delighting her clientele and expanding her brand.                        102     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","Work Done by an Entrepreneur                    When an entrepreneur runs a business:                   •  They use their creativity to come up with a new business idea that will                    fulfil the changing demands of the customers.                  •  They use the available material and people available around them in an                    innovative way merged with new technology to create new products.                  •  They work for the welfare of the society by saving the environment,                    contributing their money to build new schools and hospitals in their locality.                  •  They create jobs by hiring the skilled and unskilled labourers and helps in bridging the gap of unemployment.                  •  With the success of an entrepreneur the people connecting to it, all shares the success and thus helps in the                    overall development of the country.                  •  With the increasing competition of the entrepreneurs in the market, the products are available at low and                    competitive cost.                  What do Entrepreneurs do when they Run their Business?                   Entrepreneurs manage their business operations, making strategic decisions to drive growth and profitability. They                  also innovate, adapt to market changes, and solve problems to meet customer needs and demands. Some of the                  actions of entrepreneurs are listed below:                  •  Fulfil Customer Needs: Demand means a product or service that people want. Entrepreneurs find out what                    people want. Then, they use their creativity to come up with a business idea that will fulfil the changing demands                    of the customers.                  •  Use Local Materials: Entrepreneurs utilise available materials and people around them in innovative ways,                    combined with new technology, to create new products at a reasonable cost.                   •  Help Society: Entrepreneurs foster a beneficial relationship with society by generating profits through activities                    that  enhance  societal well-being.  Some entrepreneurs  focus on environmental  conservation,  while others                    contribute funds for building schools and hospitals, thereby improving the communities in which they live.                   •  Develop the Country: With the success of an entrepreneur the people connected to it all share the success and                    thus helps in the overall development of the country.                  How do You Think Entrepreneurs Effect the Society they Live in?                   Entrepreneurs can positively impact society by driving economic growth, and introducing innovative solutions to                  societal challenges. Their businesses often contribute to community development and inspire others to pursue                  entrepreneurship. Some of their initiatives are explained below:                  •  Create Jobs: With the growth of a business, entrepreneurs look for more people to help them. They buy more                    material, and from more people. They create jobs by hiring the skilled and unskilled labourers and help in                    bridging the gap of unemployment.                  •  Sharing of Wealth: Wealth signifies having sufficient money to lead a comfortable life.

Some of the important functions of an entrepreneur are:               •  Making Decisions: Entrepreneurs make their own decisions. They have to decide on many things to steer their                 business in the right direction.                 These decisions can be big or small and cover everything from what to sell and how much to charge, whom to                 hire and how to spend money.

Only it needs a potential idea                    and a proper execution to become reality.                  •  Only a Person having a Big Business is an Entrepreneur: Entrepreneurs                    are  individuals who  identify  opportunities,  take  risks and  innovate  to                    bring new products, services or solutions to the market. This can happen                    in business of any size. Many successful entrepreneurs start with small                    business and gradually scale up.                  •  A Lot of Money is Required to Start any Business: The amount of money you invest in a business varies                    depending on the type of business. If you are selling an idea, then no investment is required. Somewhere you need                    very little money to begin and survive in a business. Depending on how much money you have or can borrow, you can                    start a business with that much money. Once you make more money, you can put that into your business to                    make it bigger.                           Entrepreneurship as a Career Option                    Every entrepreneur has a different reason to start their own business. Some                  were sure from the beginning that they wanted to be self-employed and                  work for themselves. Others after working for fixed hours and fixed salaries                  as wage employed decided to shift to entrepreneurship. After getting the                  awareness of the two career choices, it is important to understand, how                  taking the route of entrepreneurship benefits an individual.                  A career is a line of work that a person takes for life. A person who becomes                  an entrepreneur goes through a career process. This process is as follows:                  •  Enter: It means implementing an idea by starting a business and entering a new market. For example, Amit is                    starting a small stationery store in his locality.                  •  Survive: It means to remain in the competitive market in between other entrepreneurs dealing with the same                    business. For example, there are many other stationery stores in the area. Despite this, Amit is surviving the                    competition and doing well. He even bought the next-door shop and expanded his small store to a big fancy                    stationery outlet.                  •  Grow: It means after attaining a reputation and stability, an entrepreneur plans to expand the existing business.                    For example, after a few years, Amit has opened a chain of three more stationery stores in the same city. He even                    plans to expand it to other neighboring cities as a new brand.                  Some of the job opportunities for entrepreneurship are:                  •  Business consultants                              •  New venture developers                  •  Fundraisers and money providers                   •  Freelancers in different fields                  •  Market manager                                    •  Start or own a business                  •  Franchise operators                               •  Research and development executives                  •  Educationist                                      •  Financial advisors                  •  Web developers                                    •  System analysts                                                                                           Entrepreneurial Skills-II  109","Before you plan to start your own business, you need to introspect yourself whether you should go for it or not               by asking the following questions:               •  Why do I want to start a business?               •  Can this business idea give me money and respect at present and in the future?               •  Who is my target customer for business?               •  Who are my competitors?               •  What are my marketing strategies?               •  How much investment is required?               •  What is my risk-taking capacity?                •  What are my strong and weak points to run my business?               •  What are the future prospects of my business?               •  Do I have a backup plan in case of a failure?               •  What all will be at stake?

Following are some of the functions performed by an entrepreneur:                        ●   Divide Income: Dividing income wisely is essential for the financial health and sustainability of the business. Entrepreneurs                           need to figure out what to do with the money their business makes. Dividing income involves making decisions                           about how to use the profits.

In your opinion, what is more important when starting a new business: creativity or market research?                   Ans.  In starting a new business, both creativity and market research are vital, but market research holds a slight edge.                        Understanding  customers'  needs  and  market  trends  through  research  provides  a  solid  foundation  for  developing                        products or services that meet specific demands. Creativity then comes into play to innovate and differentiate within                        that market, ensuring the business offers unique value and stands out from competitors.

This interaction is crucial for                  our survival. However, we have exploited the environment extensively to meet our needs and have contaminated                  it with various types of pollution. This exploitation has led to land degradation, disrupted ecosystems, and drastic                  climatic changes. In the last two decades, humans have caused more damage to the planet and the environment                  than ever before. It seems that we will end up leaving a barren land with no water and intense global warming for                  the generations to come.                   The solution to the above problem is that we all work together to promote the progress of society by sustaining                  our environment. This unit deals in detail about the importance and challenges related to sustainable development.                            What is Sustainable Development?                    As per the Collins English Dictionary, ‘the ability to be maintained at                  a steady level’ is sustainability. Sustainable development was defined   Economy         Environment                  in the  World  Commission  on Environment  and  Development 1987                                                                                                SUSTAINABLE                  Brundtland  Report  “Our  Common Future”  as “development  that              DEVELOPMENT                  meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of                  future generations to meet their own needs”.                   Sustainable development is the development that satisfies the needs of            Social                  the present without compromising the capacity of future generations,           Community                  guaranteeing the balance between economic growth, environmental                  care, and social well-being.                   The purpose of sustainable development is to keep a balance between economic, environmental, and social needs.                  It requires the active participation of individuals, businesses, administrations, and countries around the world to find                  better ways of doing things so that the present generation can give back to nature for our future generations to                  thrive. All nations across the globe need to stand together to contribute through small actions to bring long-term                  sustainability of the environment for sustainable social and economic growth.

The importance of sustainable development               lies in the fact that:               •  It initiates and promotes approaches for development, conservation, and protection of natural resources to stop                 environmental degradation.               •  It makes us aware of the sensible consumption of our natural resources by reducing, recycling, and reusing                 available resources.               •  It gives solutions in terms of clean energy usage at all levels by efficient use of wind, solar, water energy, etc.               •  It ensures environmentally sustainable economic growth.               •  It provides methods and alternatives to reduce the impact of air, water, and soil pollution on our environment.               •  It supports equality of income, sex, age, disability, race,  religion and opportunity  for social  and economic                 development of the society.               •  It supports the concept of smart and sustainable cities with developed transport, clean water and sanitation,                 quality education, and decent employment to all.               •  It promotes the use of more environment friendly technologies based on the efficient use of resources.               •  All the nations across the globe are together in support of implementing these goals in an effective manner.                         Problems Related to Sustainable Development                 There are three major problems related to sustainable development. Let us discuss them one-by-one.                Food                 As we are using up more and more land for designing concrete jungles, we are reducing the land for cultivation of               crops. Soil nutrients are also depleting due to pollution from industries, overgrasing of land etc. Overpopulation is               another threat for the shortage of food all across the world.                                                118     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","Water                   The supply of fresh drinking water from rivers and ponds is limited worldwide. Due to pollution, these water bodies                  are contaminated, leaving very little water available for actual use.                                            Fuel                    Forests are cut down for fuel leaving barren land where soil erosion will lead to soil degradation and a drastic                  change in climatic conditions. An increase in the consumption of oil and natural gas has led to an increase in the                  level of carbon dioxide causing a change in the climatic conditions. We are using a lot of wood from trees for the                  construction of homes and furniture. Extreme weather conditions, such as floods, extreme cold, or heat, are seen                  in many places, which affect the people living there.                                          An environment friendly method for power production is utilising solar energy, which is derived from the unlimited                  energy of the sun. Sustainable Development includes:                  •  reducing excessive use of resources and enhancing resources conservation.                  •  recycling and reuse of waste materials.                  •  scientific management of renewable resources, especially bio-resources.                  •  planting more trees.                  •  green grassy patches and trees to be interspersed between concrete buildings.                  •  using more environment friendly material or biodegradable material.                  •  use of technologies, which are environmental friendly and based on efficient use of resources.                                                                                                 Green Skills-II  119","Challenges to Sustainable Development                 The SDG has many challenges despite getting support all over the world. Some of the challenges are listed below:                •  A large population in most of the countries is unemployed, living in underprivileged conditions, uneducated and                 have a fixed mindset and behaviour which is very difficult to change. Though many NGOs and non-profitable                 organisations with support from government and international bodies are working to educate them and bring                 awareness, it has many hurdles and challenges which are not easy and time-consuming also.               •  With the existing issues of climate change, the number of species both on land and water has become extinct                 and many are on the verge of their extinction. Under such circumstances striking a balance in the food chain to                 bring back the balance in different forms of the ecosystem is a big responsibility.               •  Many countries and companies are still giving priority to their own profits, at the cost of overuse and exploitation                 of natural resources.               •  Many countries want to show their power and prove themselves best by using their nuclear weapons and                 encouraging  the destruction of nature  and  mankind. In such conditions, ensuring world  peace  is a global                 challenge.               •  Many countries are still not serious about taking the initiatives and implementing the policies in favour of SDGs.                 Due to this lack of interest, there is a huge world population which is still insensitive towards its needs.                          Green Skills                 The specialised skills which are important for building or developing a Sustainable Green Economy are called               Green Skills. Learning green skills is one of the major ways to enhance knowledge, abilities, values, and attitudes               to develop and support organisations that focus on improving environmental conditions.                The Government of India launched the Green Skills Development Programme (GSDP) in India in the year 2017,               started by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change MoEFCC in partnership with the National Skill               Development Agency (NSDA). It aims to develop green skilled workers having technical knowledge and commitment               to sustainable development. The program supports the attainment of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs),               Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), National Biodiversity Targets (NBTs) and Waste Management Rules 2016.                          Sustainable Development Goals—Agenda 2030                 The  Sustainable  Development  Goals  also  known  as  the  Global  Goals,  are  a  universal  approach  for  improving               our world. These 17 interconnected universal goals were approved by the United Nations General Assembly in               2015 and are expected to be achieved by the year 2030. These are the blueprints to achieve a better and more               sustainable future for all.               They aim to address a wide range of global challenges, including poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental               degradation, peace, and justice, which affect businesses, governments, and society.               These 17 Sustainable Development Goals and our role in Sustainable Development can be explained as follows:                •  Goal 1—No Poverty: This goal ensures that all people, especially the poorest and most vulnerable, have equal                 rights to access natural and economic resources, basic necessary services including land so that all nations are                 able to end poverty in all its forms everywhere.                   It helps people live better lives. By reducing poverty, more people can get good jobs, healthcare, and education,                 which leads to a stronger economy and healthier communities. It also helps create a more equal society with less                 conflict. Additionally, when people are not struggling to survive, they can take better care of the environment.                       120     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","For example, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) provides guaranteed                    wage employment to rural households, thereby enhancing income and reducing poverty.                  •  Goal 2—Zero Hunger: This goal ensures all people, especially children, have sufficient and nutritious food. This                    requires international cooperation for promoting sustainable agriculture so that together we can end all forms                    of hunger and malnutrition by 2030.                     It ensures everyone has enough food, which improves health and reduces diseases. Well-fed children do better                    in school, leading to brighter futures. Healthy people are more productive, boosting the economy. Reducing                    hunger also creates more stable and peaceful communities.                     For example, National Food Security Act (NFSA) aims to provide subsidised food grains to approximately two-                    thirds of the population, ensuring food security and reducing hunger.                  •  Goal 3—Good Health and Well-being: This goal ensures a minimum number of deaths and illnesses by giving                    healthy lifestyles, preventive measures from both communicable and non-communicable diseases including                    hazardous chemicals and air, water, and soil pollution so that it promotes healthy lives and well-being for all                    people at all ages.                      It ensures access to quality healthcare, reducing illness and deaths. Healthy people can work and learn better,                    boosting productivity and economic growth. It also promotes mental well-being, leading to happier and more                    fulfilled lives.                     For example, Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY) provides health insurance coverage                    to  over  500  million  vulnerable  individuals,  promoting  access  to  quality  healthcare  and  improving  health                    outcomes.

Education gives you knowledge related  to different  things that  you come across in your  daily life. Quality                    education will provide a strong foundation for financial security. This will improve their standard of living and                    will give them a way to move out of poverty. It will enlighten the youth to contribute in all possible ways to the                    social and economic development of their community which is another important factor to fulfill many other                    related sustainable development goals.                      For example, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) aims at universalising elementary education and ensuring quality                    education for all children up to the age of 14.                  •  Goal 5—Gender Equality: This goal ensures that people of all genders have equal rights and opportunities so                    that they have the power to shape their own lives and contribute to the development of society.                                                                                                Green Skills-II  121","It ensures that women and men have equal opportunities in education, work, and decision-making. This leads to                 greater economic growth and more innovative solutions to problems. By promoting gender equality, we create                 a more inclusive, harmonious, and prosperous world for everyone.                  For example, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP) Campaign aims to address gender imbalance and promote the                 education of girls, focusing on changing societal attitudes and improving the status of girls in India.               •  Goal 6—Clean Water and Sanitation: This goal ensures the availability of clean and safe water for drinking                 with proper water resources management at all levels, protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems, and                 providing adequate and equal sanitation and hygiene for all.                  Clean water for drinking and adequate sanitation is the basic human right. We have seen this during the time                 of COVID-19 that access to water, sanitation, and hygiene services is the basic requirement to fight against                 the COVID-19 virus which is an urgent need of the time for preserving the health and well-being of millions.                 Pollution from industries and open defecation practices are polluting water resources, thereby causing numerous                 diseases among the people living in those areas.                  For example, Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) promotes cleanliness and eliminate open defecation by ensuring                 access to safe sanitation facilities and promoting hygiene practices across India.               •  Goal 7—Affordable and Clean Energy: This goal focuses on improved infrastructure with upgraded technology                 to provide universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern renewable energy for all.                  This focuses on investing in clean energy sources such as solar, wind, and thermal at affordable prices. This is                 an initiative for preserving renewable energy sources, reducing the greenhouse effect, reducing harmful smog,                 and preventing toxic build-ups in our air and water. All these will help in reducing our impact on climate change                 and creating a sustainable energy future. Using solar power, which is generated from the sun, does not cause                 pollution because it does not require the burning of non-renewable fuels like coal. Similarly, biogas is an eco-                 friendly alternative to natural gas. We should encourage solar power generation because it fulfils our electricity                 needs, do not pollute the environment, use natural resources.                   For example, Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) aims to improve the financial and operational efficiency                 of power distribution companies, promoting sustainable and affordable energy access.                •  Goal 8—Decent  Work and Economic  Growth: This goal  aims to  protect  labour  rights,  end  slavery  and                 child labour, provide decent work, and fulfil jobs including entrepreneurship. This goal is crucial for achieving                 sustainable economic development and  ensuring that economic growth  benefits all individuals, promoting                 social inclusion and reducing inequalities.                  People with decent jobs will benefit society by being productive and will contribute to the economic growth of                 the country. Unemployment can lead to unrest and anti-social activities will increase in the society. We can study                 and find good jobs to take care of ourselves and our families, work hard and contribute to society, learn and                 develop skills so that we add value to our community.                   For  example,  Skill  India  Mission  aims  to  train  over  400  million  people  in  various  skills  by  2022,  promoting                 employment generation and entrepreneurship for sustainable economic growth.                •  Goal 9—Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure: This goal ensures equal and universal access to information                 and financial markets by providing inclusive and sustainable industrialisation with developed and sustainable                 infrastructure to all nations across the globe.                   By investing in modern infrastructure and fostering innovation, this goal supports job creation and enhances                 productivity. Improved infrastructure, such as roads and electricity, enables easier access to markets and essential                 services, benefiting communities and businesses alike. Innovation promotes new technologies and solutions for                 sustainable development, addressing challenges like climate change and resource scarcity.                   For example, Make in India Initiative promotes manufacturing  and innovation in India by encouraging                 multinational and domestic companies to manufacture their products in the country, fostering industrial growth                 and infrastructure development.                      122     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","•  Goal 10—Reduced Inequalities: This goal ensures equality and prosperity to all irrespective of gender, race,                    religion, or economic status by improving and monitoring global financial markets for the financial and social                    progress of all people in all nations.                     Inequalities based on income, sex, age, disability, race, religion, and opportunity will slow down the process of                    social and economic development of the society. Greater efforts at all levels are needed to educate people which                    in turn will reduce inequalities, poverty, and hunger. To reduce inequalities, we can be helpful to one another, be                    friendly with everyone, include everyone while working or playing, help others by including everyone whether                    they are small or big, girl or boy, belong to any class or caste.                      For example, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act aims to prevent atrocities                    against marginalised communities and promote equality by ensuring legal protection and rights for Scheduled                    Castes and Scheduled Tribes in India.                  •  Goal 11—Sustainable Cities and Communities: This goal ensures in providing adequate, safe, sustainable and                    affordable housing, and basic services and upgrading slums, and affordable transport systems with improved                    road safety by building modern cities with green and clean-living conditions.                      For our societies and countries to prosper at present and in future we all need to have cleaner, greener, and                    modern sustainable cities. For creating sustainable cities, we need to save energy by switching off lights and fans                    when not in use, use natural light as much as possible, use energy-efficient lights (LED bulbs) and appliances.                      For example, Smart Cities Mission aims to develop 100 cities across India with core infrastructure, sustainable                    environment, and smart solutions to improve quality of life and promote sustainable urban development.                   •  Goal 12—Responsible  Consumption  and Production: This goal ensures responsible consumption and                    production by all nations for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature.                      Responsible consumers are conscious of their consumption habits and contribute to a more positive impact on                    society and the environment from the producers of goods and services. Producers should go for the production                    of goods with negative environmental impacts such as soil, water, greenhouse gas emissions and degradation                    of ecosystems.                     We can become responsible for our environment by reusing paper, glass, plastic, water etc., taking cloth bags to                    the market carrying fruits and vegetables, donating things we do not use such as clothes books, furniture, food,                    etc., buying and eating seasonal fruits and vegetables from local growers, repairing leaking taps and pipes to                    avoid washing water, sorting and treating garbage before disposing.                     For  example,  Swachh  Bharat  Mission  (Clean  India  Mission)  focuses  on  improving  sanitation  and  promoting                    cleanliness across rural and urban India, contributing to sustainable consumption and production patterns.                  •  Goal 13—Climate Action: This goal requires immediate action to save our climate from drastic changes through                    education, innovation, and participation by all nations to protect the planet.                     It aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which helps slow down global warming and its harmful effects                    like extreme weather  and  rising sea levels. By promoting renewable  energy  and  sustainable practices,  this                    goal supports cleaner air and water, improving public health. Climate action also fosters innovation in green                    technologies, creating new jobs and economic opportunities. Additionally, it encourages global cooperation to                    protect ecosystems and biodiversity, ensuring a more resilient planet for future generations.

It is developed and                  maintained by Canonical Ltd. Ubuntu is known for its user-friendly interface, ease of use, and robust community                  support.                                                  Working with Directories                  In Ubuntu OS, as in any other operating system, files and directories serve fundamental roles in organising and                  managing data within the file system.                  Directories (Folders) in Ubuntu are containers that are used to organise and group related files and subdirectories.                  In directories, files and subdirectories are arranged in the hierarchical structure (tree-like structure). In Ubuntu OS,                  the root directory is denoted by /. This is the top-level directory in the file system hierarchy. Everything starts from                  here.                                                                      /                         /bin  /boot  /dev  /etc  /home  /lib  /media /mnt  /opt  /proc  /sbin  /srv  /sys  /tmp  /usr  /var                    Some commonly used directories in Ubuntu are:                  •  /bin: It contains essential binaries (executable files) that are required for system operation. Common commands                    like ls, cp, mv, etc., reside here.                  •  /boot: It contains files necessary for booting the system, such as the kernel, bootloader configuration, and other                    boot-related files.                  •  /dev: It contains device files, which are used to interact with hardware devices.                  •  /etc: It contains system-wide  configuration  files. Configuration  files for  various  services and  programs  are                    typically stored here.                                                                                           Ubuntu Operating System    131","•  /home: It contains home directories for users. Each user typically has their own subdirectory here, where they                 can store their files and personal settings.               •  /lib: It contains shared libraries needed by programs in /bin and /sbin for booting and repairing the system.               •  /media: It is the mount point for removable media devices such as USB drives, CDs, etc.                •  /mnt: It is the temporary mount point for mounting file systems manually.               •  /opt: It contains additional software packages that are not part of the default installation.               •  /proc: It contains information about currently running processes and system resources.                •  /sbin: It contains binaries that are essential for system administration tasks.               •  /srv: It contains data for services provided by the system.               •  /sys: It contains information about devices, drivers, and some kernel features. It’s similar to /proc but more                 structured.               •  /tmp: It contains temporary files that are not needed across reboots. Any user can write to this directory.               •  /usr: It contains the majority of user utilities and applications. It’s further divided into subdirectories like /usr/                 bin, /usr/lib, /usr/share, etc.               •  /var: It contains variable data files, such as logs, spool files, and temporary e-mail files.

Most of the companies use Al to accomplish their mundane                  tasks and achieve their company's long-term goals. As we know that AI enables us to make smart machines that                  can do things humans find hard to do, such as analysing large amounts of data quickly, recognising speech,                  translating languages, or even driving cars.

Introducing AI Project Cycle                    Suppose you are preparing a cake for a friend's birthday. Here is a possible step-by-step breakdown of the                  process:                     • Find a recipe: Start by searching for cake recipes that match the flavour your friend likes. You might check                    cookbooks, online videos, or ask someone who knows how to bake.                     • List ingredients: After choosing a recipe, make a list of all the ingredients and tools needed, like flour, sugar,                    eggs, a mixing bowl, etc.                     • Check your pantry: See if you already have the required ingredients and tools. If anything is missing, go out                    and buy it.                     • Bake the cake: Follow the recipe step by step, mixing, baking and everything as instructed.                      • Fix any mistakes: If the cake doesn’t turn out right—for example, if it’s undercooked or uneven—you might                    have to start over and fix the problem.                      • Decorate and present: Once the cake is ready, decorate it beautifully and present it to your friend as a heartfelt                    birthday surprise.                  This process is structured, like a project, to ensure your cake turns out perfect and brings joy to your friend on                  his/her special day!                                                                  Revisiting AI Project Cycle \& Ethical Frameworks for AI   137","For all kinds of tasks, we usually follow a plan knowingly or unknowingly. The steps taken to complete a task               from the beginning to its end are called Project Cycle. These steps help us complete the task effectively.                Similarly, if we have to develop an AI project, we need to follow the AI project cycle that provides us with an               appropriate framework to lead us towards our goal. The AI project cycle is a roadmap to plan, develop and               deploy AI solutions. The AI project cycle provides us with a framework for planning, organising, executing and               implementing an AI project to accomplish a task. It is a structured approach to move from the conception of an               AI idea to its practical implementation and sustained operation.                Following a well-defined AI project cycle ensures that every stage of the AI project is methodical and minimises               unforeseen issues. The following figure shows six stages of the AI project cycle:                                                                Problem                                                               Scoping                                                                                      Data                                             Deployment                                                                                Acquisition                                                                                        Data                                             Evaluation                                                                               Exploration                                                                  Modelling                 The description of these six stages is as follows:                  Stage 1   Problem Scoping                The first stage of an AI project cycle is Problem Scoping, where the problem is clearly identified, and a vision               for addressing the same is developed. It is a crucial step where the focus is thoroughly on understanding the               problem by considering the various factors that influence it, and determining how AI technology can provide a               solution.               To achieve a comprehensive understanding, this phase emphasises the use of the 4W’s: Who, What, Where,               and  Why.  This  approach  ensures  that  all  critical  components  of  the  problem  are  clearly  defined,  aligning               stakeholders and team members.                  • Who: This step identifies who will be affected from the AI solution, as well as any stakeholders involved in the                  project. It considers the target audience, users, and decision-makers.                   • What: This step defines the specific problem or challenge that needs to be addressed with AI.

This stage involves gathering raw data, which                  is essential for referencing or performing analysis that will guide the project. The process of data acquisition                  encompasses the collection of a wide range of data types, including text, numerical values, images, videos, and                  audio. These various forms of data can be sourced from multiple places such as the internet, academic journals,                  newspapers, and other relevant publications or databases. The goal of data acquisition is to capture accurate                  and valuable information that reflects real-world scenarios. This collected data serves as a foundation of the                  project that provides valuable insights and enabling the improvement of the project’s performance and the                  development of more precise AI solutions.                     Stage 3   Data Exploration                   Data exploration is a crucial step that involves analysing large volumes of data to uncover meaningful patterns,                  trends, and relationships using various data visualisation and statistical techniques. By transforming raw data                  into visual formats such as charts, graphs, and plots, data scientists can more easily interpret and draw insights                  from the information. This analytical approach not only helps to reveal underlying structures within the dataset                  but also facilitates the identification of anomalies or irregularities, ultimately laying the groundwork for more                  informed and effective decision-making in subsequent stages of the AI project.                    Stage 4   Modelling                   The design phase is an important stage in the AI project cycle, ensuring that AI systems function effectively.                  Data modeling is a foundational step within the AI development process, happening before model training. It                  involves identifying and defining the relationships between different data entities, ensuring that the AI model                  can understand the connections and dependencies within the data. The quality of the data model significantly                  impacts the performance of the AI model, as well-structured data enables better learning and more accurate                  predictions.                    Additionally,  comparative  analysis  is  performed  to  understand  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  each                  model. This helps in identifying the most effective solution that aligns with the project goals and constraints.                  The design phase often involves iterative refinement, where initial models are fine-tuned based on feedback or                  preliminary testing.                                                               Revisiting AI Project Cycle \& Ethical Frameworks for AI   139","Stage 5   Evaluation                The testing phase of the AI project cycle is a critical step where the model's performance is evaluated to ensure it               meets the predefined goals and requirements. If the model does not fulfil the required objectives, modifications               may be necessary. Once  the  developer  ensures  the  model achieves satisfactory  results  and aligns  with the               project's goals, the AI project proceeds to the deployment phase. This means the project will be transitioned               into an operational state, where it is fully implemented and handed over to the end-user for practical use.                  Stage 6   Deployment                In  this  phase,  the  best-performing  model  is  seamlessly  integrated  into  the  production  environment.  This               integration  involves  implementing  the  model  in  a  real-world  setting  where  it  can  be  used  for  practical               applications. Additionally, this stage requires setting up a system for continuous monitoring to ensure that the               model consistently delivers accurate and reliable results over time. Ongoing maintenance is also established               to  address  any  potential  issues  that  might  arise,  such  as  changes  in  the  data,  evolving  requirements,  or               performance degradation.

In this domain, AI systems are designed to collect                  vast amounts of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from various sources, organise and maintain                  data sets, and apply statistical and machine learning techniques to derive meaningful information from them.                   The  information  extracted  through  statistical  data  analysis  can  be  utilised  to  identify  patterns,  trends,  and                  relationships  within  the  data.  This  information  serves  as  a  foundation  for  data-driven  decision-making  that                  enables organisations and systems to make informed predictions, optimise processes, and solve complex problems.                  For instance, if I plan to host an outdoor event in August in Delhi, I would need to collect data on weather                  forecasts for that month, as well as historical weather trends from previous years. This data will serve as the basis                  for identifying patterns, which can then be used to make predictions about the likely weather conditions on the                  day of the event. In the world of AI, data is the most important asset.                   Once data is gathered from various sources, AI systems analyse and process it to extract valuable insights. These                  insights help AI machines recognise patterns, make informed predictions, and even improve decision-making                  processes over time. Predictive models, which are built from historical data patterns, can be used in various                  fields such as weather forecasting, healthcare, finance, and more. Therefore, data is not just the starting point;                  it’s the very core of the analysis and machine learning process, enabling AI to learn and evolve its capabilities.

By analysing pixel data, it aims to replicate               human visual capabilities, such as object recognition, scene understanding, and motion tracking.               It involves capturing images or videos, processing them, and analysing the details to make sense of what’s in               them. After this analysis, the machine can make decisions or take actions based on what it has understood.                The process starts with collecting visual data—this could be a photograph, a video, or even images from special               sensors  like  thermal  cameras.  Then,  the  computer  works  to  analyse  and  identify  important  details,  such  as               objects, shapes, or patterns. Once it understands the visual content, it can act on it, like recognising a face,               detecting obstacles, or reading a sign.               Applications of Computer Vision                 Some of the applications of computer vision are:                  • Object detection: Google Lens is an application of Google that can identify objects in images by analysing                  a photo taken from the real world. It uses the object detection algorithm to recognise and identify an object                  within images. For example, if you are unaware of the name of a flower in your garden, click a picture with your                  phone using Google Lens application and it will reveal its name along with the description.                                                • Face lock in smartphones: Smartphones  come with  a  security  system of using facial  recognition  to  lock                  and unlock smartphones. It uses the front camera and computer vision algorithms to map and store facial                  features securely. Once it is stored, every time to unlock it matches the input face with the features already                  stored in it.                          146     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","• Self-driving cars: Self-driving cars utilise CV to recognise objects such as lamp posts, pedestrian crossings,                    and stop signs.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the domain of artificial intelligence focused on enabling machines to               understand, analyse, and interact with humans through natural language. NLP works with two main types of               data: text and speech. It combines the fields of linguistics and computer science to analyse language structure               and provide guidelines to make models which can comprehend, break down and separate significant details               from text and speech. For example, social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) use NLP to identify and filter               out harmful content in user tweets. Amazon uses NLP to analyse customer reviews and improve user experience.                Applications of Natural Language Processing                 Some of the real-time applications of NLP are:                  • Plagiarism Checker: It uses NLP to search through online repositories and identify any cases of published                  content that match your work line by line, warning you about them.                                                • Email Filters:  In  Gmail,  emails  are  automatically  categorised  into  three  primary  tabs:  Primary,  Social,  and                  Promotions.  This  categorisation  leverages  NLP  to  analyse  the  content  of  emails.  NLP  identifies  specific                  keywords, phrases, and patterns to determine the appropriate category for each email.                              150     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","Similarly, emails marked as Spam are filtered using the same NLP techniques.

However, it has since been upgraded due to                    privacy concerns.                     • AI mistakes: AI systems can make errors that have serious consequences. For example, Uber’s self-driving cars                    ran through red lights during a test, and Microsoft’s chatbot Tay started posting offensive messages online                    shortly after its launch.                     • Autonomous weapons: AI is used to create \"killer robots\" that can make decisions on their own. These weapons                    are risky because they could be misused or hacked, leading to dangerous situations.                     • Bias and discrimination: AI systems learn from data, and if the data is biased, the AI can also become biased.                    This has caused problems, such as unfair hiring decisions or facial recognition systems not working well for                    certain groups of people.                     • Environmental impact: Running AI systems requires a lot of electricity, which can harm the environment by                    increasing carbon emissions. This makes it important to consider how we can use AI in a more eco-friendly way.                           Ethical Frameworks of AI                    Frameworks are a series of actions that is designed to help in addressing problems. They offer a methodical                  approach for solving problem in a systematic manner that guarantees every relevant aspect and situations are                  considered. Framework also serves as a common language for collaboration and interaction, which makes it                  easier to share efficient procedures and encourages consistency in approaches for solving problems.                  Ethics are morals or values that assist us in identifying what is right and what is wrong. Ethical frameworks                  provide a valuable tool that help us in dealing with complicated moral issues. They offer a structured approach                  that assists both individuals and organisational level decision-making by considering their ethical viewpoints.                  Such a systematic approach guarantees that possible consequences are sensibly assessed and it minimises the                  risk of unintentional negative results. By adhering ethical frameworks, individuals and organisations can make                  choices that align with their values, promote beneficial outcomes for all stakeholders, and improve the overall                  responsibility and ethical decision-making.

Need of Ethical Frameworks for AI                 Ethical frameworks are important to ensure AI development matches the goals for the development of human               beings. They help in addressing the problems to achieve the SDGs making AI more trustworthy, safer and its               development in a responsible way.               The need for the ethical framework is given below:                  • Fairness and bias: AI should treat everyone equally. Ethical frameworks help reduce bias in AI, ensuring                  it do not favour one group over another. This ensures all individuals are given equal opportunities and                  treatment.                   • Privacy and data protection: AI uses a lot of personal data, so guidelines are needed to protect people’s                  privacy and ensure data is used responsibly. Clear rules help prevent misuse and ensure data security.                  • Environmental impact: AI systems can use a lot of energy. Ethical frameworks encourage creating AI that uses                  less energy and is better for the environment. This ensures that AI doesn’t harm the planet while advancing                  technology.                   • Accountability: People are impacted by the decisions made by AI. There need to be methods for comprehending                  and contesting these choices. This guarantees that AI is responsible for its deeds.                  • Transparency and explainability:  AI  decision-making  should  be  understandable  to  the  general  public,                  particularly  in  critical  domains  like  healthcare  and  finance.  In  addition  to  building  trust,  this  improves  the                  identification of mistakes.                  • Effects on employment: Since AI has the potential to replace some professions, it's critical to support workers                  by providing them with new skill training. This makes it easier for workers to adjust to changes in the workforce                  and maintain their jobs.                        154     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","21 st  Century   #Critical Thinking                                                                                            Skills  #Technology Literacy                                     GAME         04                    My Goodness                         Visit: https://www.my-goodness.net/ or scan the QR code to write an article.

Self-driving cars, once just a                  futuristic concept, are now a common sight on the roads.                  You  own one  yourself, using  it  for your daily  commute                  and enjoying the ease it brings to your life.                  Of course, with all the advanced features it offers, the car                  is quite expensive. Now, picture this: one day, your father                  is on his way  to the office in his self-driving car.  He is                  seated in the back while the car drives itself. Suddenly,                  a small boy runs into the road. The situation unfolds so                  quickly that the car has only two options:                  Continue straight and severely injure the boy.                  Take a sharp right turn to avoid the boy, crashing into a metal pole, damaging the car, and injuring your father.                  This scenario highlights a critical ethical dilemma that developers face when designing a self-driving car's decision-                  making algorithm. Ultimately, the morality of the developer influences the machine's choices --what they believe is                  the \"right\" decision will be prioritised in the car's programming.                  If you were in the developer's position, how would you approach this dilemma?                                Scenario 2:                  Let's now assume that the car has hit the boy who stepped in front of it.

They are trained to focus on a particular sector such as technology, finance or healthcare. For instance,                    in technology, key considerations include data privacy and the responsible development of AI. In healthcare,                    the emphasis is on making fair decisions that respect everyone’s rights.                     o  Bioethics: Bioethics is an interdisciplinary framework used in healthcare to solve tough ethical problems.                       It combines ideas and principles from fields like medicine, law, and philosophy to help doctors, patients,                       and researchers make fair and respectful decisions. Bioethics ensures that healthcare decisions are made                       fairly,  respectfully,  and  in  ways  that  protect  everyone’s  rights.  This  helps  build  trust  and  improve  the                       overall quality of care.                      • Value-based ethical frameworks: These frameworks concentrate on essential ethical principles and values such                    as honesty, respect and fairness that influence decision-making. They are based on different moral beliefs and                    help us judge whether actions are right or wrong, encouraging ethical behaviour. They are further categorised                    as:                     o  Rights-based ethical frameworks: These frameworks are based on respecting and upholding individual’s                       rights. These frameworks ensure that all policies and actions focus on basic human rights. In context to AI,                       it means that AI systems should respect human rights and not discriminate any specific group.                      o  Utility-based ethical frameworks: These frameworks evaluate actions focusing on maximising overall                       good, or minimising harm. These frameworks balance benefits and costs to achieve the maximum benefit                       to the maximum number of people.

How can AI developers ensure they follow rights-based ethical framework during the design                        of an AI system?                                Exploring Bioethics                 Bioethics  is  an  ethical  framework  that  addresses  complex  moral  dilemmas  in  healthcare,  medicine,  and  the               biological sciences. It integrates principles from multiple disciplines, including medicine, law, philosophy, and               sociology, to guide ethical decision-making. The primary goal of bioethics is to ensure that healthcare decisions               are made fairly, respect individual rights, and protect human dignity.               For example, in cases such as organ transplant or end-of-life care, bioethics provides a framework to ensure that               decisions are compassionate, just, and equitable. By fostering trust, fairness, and respect, bioethics enhances the               quality of care and upholds societal values in healthcare.               Principles of Bioethics                 The  principles  of  bioethics  are  foundational  guidelines  that  help  address  moral  and  ethical  dilemmas  in               healthcare, medical research, and biological sciences. These principles ensure fairness, respect, and accountability               in decision-making. The four primary principles of bioethics are:                                                           Principles of Bioethics                              Respect of           Beneficence           Non-Maleficence                                                                                                   Justice                           Autonomy          (Maximum Benefits)        (Do Not Harm)                The description of these principles are as follows:                  • Respect of Autonomy: Autonomy emphasises  the importance of respecting an individual's right to make                  decisions about their own body and life. It values informed consent, personal choice, and self-determination.                  For example, a patient has the right to accept or refuse a medical procedure after understanding its risks and                  benefits.                  • Beneficence (Maximum Benefits): It involves promoting the well-being and welfare of an individual or society.                  In other words, it means acting in ways that support the best interests of others. In healthcare, beneficence                  requires professionals to act in the best interest of their patients by promoting well-being and taking positive                  actions to prevent harm.                      160     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","• Non-maleficence (Do Not Harm): This principle focuses on avoiding actions that could harm others whether                    intentional or unintentional to an individual or a community.                     • Justice: This principle ensures fairness in distributing healthcare resources, treatments, and opportunities. It                    emphasises on equality and avoiding discrimination in medical decision-making.

The  AI  analysed  various  data  sources,  including  medical                  records,  demographics,  social  media  activity,  and  behavioural  patterns,  to  predict  the  likelihood  of  mental                  health disorders.                   However,  the  system  introduced  unintended  consequences,  resulting  in  biased  treatment  towards  specific                  patient groups.                  The Problem It Caused                   The  AI  system  incorrectly  flagged  women  from  low-income  communities  as  having  a  higher  risk  of  mental                  health issues based on factors like their social media activity and signs of financial stress. However, many of                  these women were not experiencing mental health disorders but were dealing with financial difficulties and                  caregiving responsibilities.                   Conversely, the system failed to identify individuals from wealthier backgrounds who might also be at risk but                  did not exhibit obvious signs of stress, leading to missed opportunities for an early intervention.                  Why the Problem Happened?                      • Bias in data: The AI model was trained on datasets that primarily represented wealthier individuals with better                    access to healthcare. Social media data further amplified the issue, as people from lower-income communities                    often have limited access to online mental health resources.                     • Overemphasis on social media: The system relied excessively on social media activity (like post frequency and                    tone) to predict mental health without considering how social or economic stress factors can affect someone's                    mental health.                      • Ignoring social factors: The AI didn't take into account the broader social issues, like poverty or lack of access                    to care, which can significantly affect mental health.                  The Ethical Problems                      • Bias: The AI overestimated the mental health risks for low-income communities while overlooking others who                    needed care. This exacerbated existing healthcare inequalities.                                                               Revisiting AI Project Cycle \& Ethical Frameworks for AI   161","• Inaccuracy: If the AI makes wrong predictions, it could lead to unnecessary treatments for some individuals                  while others at risk went unnoticed, compromising the system's reliability.                   • Privacy Concerns: Using social media activity for risk predictions raised concerns about people's privacy and                  whether they were properly informed about how their data was being used.               Using Bioethics to Fix the Problem                By applying four principles of bioethics, we can improve fairness and effectiveness of AI system:                   • Respect for Autonomy                  o  Transparency and consent: Patients must be informed about how their data is used and given the choice                      to opt out of having their personal or social media data analysed.                  o  Clear communication: Mental health professionals should clearly explain how the AI system functions, its                     data sources, and its role in patient care.                   • Non-maleficence (Do Not Harm)                   o  Minimise harm:  The  AI  should  undergo  rigorous  testing  to  ensure  it  does  not  disproportionately                     misclassify or harm specific groups, such as low-income individuals.                   o  Human oversight: Predictions made by the AI should be reviewed by mental health professionals to                     mitigate potential harm.                  • Beneficence (Maximum Benefits)                   o  Benefit to all: The system should be retrained to assist all patients, especially those traditionally overlooked                     or underserved, by including diverse data from varied socio-economic, racial, and demographic groups.                   o  Data diversity: The training dataset must be expanded to better represent all populations and improve                     the system's accuracy.                   • Justice                   o  Fairness: The AI should treat all groups equitably and avoid reinforcing existing disparities.                   o  Address bias: Developers must critically assess the dataset and address any systemic biases, such as those                                                                                                                                                                                          Exercise                     related to race, gender, or class, in the AI model.

The AI project cycle provides us with a framework for planning, organising, executing and implementing an AI project to                        accomplish a task. It is a structured approach to move from the conception of an AI idea to its practical implementation                        and sustained operation.                      2.  Explain value-based ethical frameworks.                    Ans.  Value-based ethical frameworks concentrate on essential ethical principles and values such as honesty, respect and                        fairness that influence decision-making. They are based on different moral beliefs and help us judge whether actions                        are right or wrong, encouraging ethical behaviour.

Computer vision is used in agriculture for tasks like monitoring crops, detecting pests, and estimating yields. Drones                     equipped with cameras capture aerial images of farmland, which are analysed to evaluate crop health detect pests, and                     optimise farming practices.                   4.  “Google Lens is an application of Google that can be used to identify any image by clicking a picture from the real                     world.”. Explain this statement.                 Ans.   Google Lens is an application of Google that can identify objects in images by analysing a photo taken from the real                     world. It uses the object detection algorithm to recognise and identify an object within images. For example, if you are                     unaware of the name of a flower in your garden, click a picture with your phone using Google Lens application and it                     will reveal its name along with the description.                   5.  What do you mean by Bioethics?                                                    [CBSE Handbook]                 Ans.   Bioethics is an ethical framework that addresses complex moral and ethical dilemmas in healthcare, medicine, and                     biological sciences. It integrates principles from multiple disciplines, including medicine, law, philosophy, and sociology,                     to guide ethical decision-making. The primary goal of bioethics is to ensure that decisions in healthcare are made fairly,                     respect individual rights, and protect human dignity.                B.  Long answer type questions.                    1.  What is the need of ethical frameworks for AI?                 Ans.   The need of the ethical framework is given below:                     •  Fairness and bias: AI should treat everyone equally. Ethical frameworks help reduce bias in AI, ensuring it doesn’t                       favour one group over another. This ensures all individuals are given equal opportunities and treatment.                     •  Privacy and data protection: AI uses a lot of personal data, so guidelines are needed to protect people’s privacy                       and ensure data is used responsibly. Clear rules help prevent misuse and ensure data security.                     •  Environmental impact: AI systems can use a lot of energy. Ethical frameworks encourage creating AI that uses less                       energy and is better for the environment. This ensures that AI doesn’t harm the planet while advancing technology.                     •  Accountability: People are impacted by the decisions made by AI. There need to be methods for comprehending                       and contesting these choices. This guarantees that AI is responsible for its deeds.                     •  Transparency and explainability: AI decision-making should be understandable to the general public, particularly in                       critical domains like healthcare and finance. In addition to building trust, this improves the identification of mistakes.                   2.  Akhil wants to learn how to scope the problem for an AI Project.

Some applications of statistical data are as follows:                        •  Recommendation  system: Recommendation systems  use statistical  data to suggest personalised content to                          users. By analysing user behaviour, preferences, and historical interactions, AI models (e.g., collaborative filtering or                          content-based filtering) recommend products, movies, or music. Netflix, Disney + Hotstar and Amazon are prime                          examples of platforms using such systems.                        •  Price Comparison Websites: Price comparison websites are platforms that  allow users to compare  prices of                          products or services offered by multiple sellers. These websites leverage statistical data to provide insights, trends,                          and optimised pricing strategies. Statistical analysis plays a vital role in organising, interpreting, and presenting the                          vast amounts of price-related data collected from various sources.                     4.  Samarth attended a workshop on Artificial Intelligence but found the technical jargon challenging. He understood that                        AI is used in various everyday applications, but struggled to identify its core areas. Can you help Samarth list the three                        main domains of AI?                    Ans.  Artificial Intelligence comprises three key domains:                        •  Statistical  data:  Statistical  data  is  a  critical  domain  of  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI)  that  focuses  on  the  collection,                          management, analysis, and interpretation of data systems and processes. In this domain, AI systems are designed                          to collect vast amounts of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from various sources, organise and                          maintain data sets, and apply statistical and machine learning techniques to derive meaningful information from                          them.                        •  Computer Vision: Computer vision is the domain of artificial intelligence that empowers computers to interpret,                          analyse and understand an image or a video by collecting information from pixels. By analysing pixel data, it aims to                          replicate human visual capabilities, such as object recognition, scene understanding, and motion tracking.                        •  Natural  Language Processing:  Natural  Language  Processing  is  the  domain  of  artificial  intelligence  focused  on                          enabling machines to understand, analyse, and interact with humans through natural language. NLP works with two                          main types of data: text and speech. It combines the fields of linguistics and computer science to analyse language                          structure  and  provide  guidelines  to  make  models  which  can  comprehend,  break  down  and  separate  significant                          details from text and speech.                     5.  Describe the principles of Bioethics.                    Ans.  The principles of bioethics are as follows:                        •  Respect of Autonomy: Autonomy emphasises respecting an individual's right to make decisions about their own                          body and life. It values informed consent, personal choice, and self-determination. For example, a patient has the                          right to accept or refuse a medical procedure after understanding its risks and benefits.                        •  Beneficence (Maximum Benefits): It includes promoting the wellbeing and welfare of an individual or a society. In                          other words, it involves acting in ways that promote the well-being and best interests of others.  Beneficence requires                          healthcare professionals to act in the best interest of the patient, promoting well-being and taking positive actions                          to prevent harm.                        •  Non-maleficence  (Do Not Harm):  This  principle  focuses  on  avoiding  actions  that  could  harm  others  whether                          intentional or unintentional to an individual or a community.                        •  Justice:  This  principle  ensures  fairness  in  distributing  healthcare  resources,  treatments,  and  opportunities.  It                          emphasises equality and avoiding discrimination in medical decision-making.

As AI becomes more involved in our everyday lives, people are concerned about how much                    we depend on it. While AI can improve efficiency and accuracy, there are worries about the risks of relying on it                    for everything. Should we fully depend on AI, or is it important to keep human judgment and control in important                    decisions? This ongoing debate shows both the advantages and risks of using AI.

It imitates some abilities of the human brain,               such as recognising patterns and understanding information, but it cannot fully match the brain’s complexity.                ML                ML stands for Machine Learning, which is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. It uses statistical methods to enable               machines to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine Learning is one               of the most widely used techniques for building AI systems worldwide. It involves teaching machines to interpret,               process, and analyse data to solve problems effectively.

It uses a face recognition algorithm for the same.                                      • Speech Recognition: We all love to speak out our messages to Siri, Google assistant, Amazon Alexa etc. These                 speech recognition devices use machine learning to understand spoken language and convert speech to text                 and respond accordingly.                                   • Anomaly Detection: In medical diagnostics, anomaly detection helps in identifying unusual patient readings,                 such as abnormal heart rates or spikes in blood pressure. For instance, by analysing patient data like age,                 blood pressure, and heart rate, algorithms such as Isolation Forest can detect irregular patterns. These flagged                 anomalies may indicate conditions like arrhythmia or hypertension, enabling early intervention and start timely                 treatment.                                        • Fraud and Risk Detection: The Banking and finance sector uses machine learning to analyse customer data, like                 profiling, past expenditures, and other key variables to assess risks, defaults, and potential failures. This helps                 them minimise bad debts and losses by offering banking products based on a customer’s purchasing power.                         178     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","• Object Classification: ML model learns to identify and name objects in images and videos.

It is a subset of Machine Learning inspired by the structure and function of neurons                  in the human brain, leading to the development of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Deep Learning involves                  implementing  neural  networks  to  process  high-dimensional  data,  extract  meaningful  insights,  and  provide                  solutions to complex problems.                  In the hierarchy of Artificial Intelligence (AI), AI represents the broader field, with Machine Learning (ML) as a                  subset, and Deep Learning (DL) as a further specialised subset of ML. While ML focuses on algorithms to learn                  from data, DL represents the next evolution of ML.

It uses Deep Learning algorithm that takes an input image, processes it by assigning learnable weights               and biases to various aspects/objects in the image which will help the system to differentiate one image from the               other with maximum accuracy. We can say that ANN reduces size, improves features and gives the probability               value of the input image.

A collection of data provided to a machine learning model to help it analyse and learn patterns is called training                  data. Just like how a teacher explains any concept to students through examples and illustrations, helping them                  understand and solve similar problems. Similarly, a set of labelled data (features and their corresponding labels) is                  used to train the AI model, teaching it how to make accurate predictions or decisions.                  What do you mean by a Testing Dataset?                   The testing data set is a collection of data provided to a machine learning model to evaluate how well it has                  learned to make predictions. Just like how a teacher gives a test to students after teaching a concept to assess their                  understanding and identify any gaps. Similarly, a set of labelled data that the model has not seen before is used to                  test its performance, ensuring it can make accurate predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.                           Modelling                     AI Modelling refers to developing algorithms, also called models which can be trained to get intelligent outputs.                  That is, writing codes to make a machine artificially intelligent. The model is trained using data.

It relies on predefined rules and facts created by developers to enable machines to perform specific tasks and               generate desired outputs. Developers manually define a set of rules that determine how the machine processes               data and responds to various scenarios.

Once trained, the machine does not               adapt to changes made in the original training dataset. If the machine is tested on a dataset that differs from the               rules and data provided during the training stage, it will fail to produce accurate results and will not learn or adjust               to the new conditions it encounters.                CASE STUDY: Banks' Chatbot                A bank's website features a chatbot to assist users with basic queries related to account management, such as               checking account balance, resetting passwords, or locating nearby ATMs.               1.  Data: The data required to train the chatbot is a simple scripted document based on questions and their                   corresponding answers.                2.  Rules: The chatbot uses a simple decision tree approach with defined rules under the category of “Yes” or “No”                   to complete the conversation. Some of the rules which bank's chatbots follow are:                   a.   Rule 1: Predefined Questions and Answers. It prompts the user for “Account Balance”, if the answer is Yes, it                     suggests a mobile app of the bank or login to an online banking account. Based on the user choice, it does                     the needful.                    b.   Rule 2: Keyword Matching. The chatbot recognises user input through keywords and matches them to                     pre-set rules in its database. For example, when a user mentions \"ATM,\" the bot asks for location details and                     retrieves nearby ATMs from a stored database.                   c.   Rule 3: Guided Flow Under the “Change Password” option. It will prompt the user to answer the details like                     registered email or phone number. It will direct the user to the login page.                   d.   Rule 4: Options and Redirection. Provides links to relevant pages (e.g., login, directions) and redirects to                     human support for more complex issues.                3.   Interaction: When a user communicates with the chatbot, it processes the message by matching it with the                   predefined rules. Depending on the situation, the chatbot replies with a ready-made response or asks for more                   details to address the query.                   The following is an example of the user interaction:                      ✶ User: \"How can I check my account balance?\"                      Chatbot: \"To check your account balance, you can use our mobile banking app or log in to your online                     banking account.

Let me                       provide you the steps:                       o  Click on \"Forgot Password.\"                        o  Enter your registered email or phone number.                       o  Follow the instructions sent to your email/phone.                       Would you like to visit the login page now?\"                        o Option 1: Yes                       o Option 2: No                         ✶ User: \"Where is the nearest ATM?\"                       Chatbot: \"Please share your current location or city name, and I'll find the nearest ATM for you.\"                        User: \"I'm in New Delhi.\"                       Chatbot: \"The nearest ATM to your location is at [ATM Address]. Would you like directions?\"                       o Option 1: Yes                        o Option 2: No                         ✶ User: \"What are your customer care hours?\"                          Chatbot: \"Our customer care team is available from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM, Monday to Saturday. For urgent                       issues, you can call our helpline at [contact number].\"                        While rule-based approach as seen in the above chatbot is effective for simple, repetitive tasks, they are                       limited in scope and flexibility. Once trained, rule-based models cannot learn or improve over time. They                       require manual updates to handle new types of queries or information. It cannot be used to personalise                       responses based on user history or preferences. Hence, learning-based models are introduced.                   Learning-based Approach                   This approach refers to the model where the relationship or patterns in the data are not defined by the developer.                  Random data is fed into the machine and the machine develops its own patterns or trends based on data outputs.                  It is an alternative method to address some of the challenges of rule-based systems.                  In a learning-based approach, the machine analyses data to identify patterns and make predictions. With unlabelled                  data, it clusters similar points based on shared features. For labelled data, it learns from past examples to map                  inputs to outputs. This approach enables data-driven decision-making by extracting meaningful insights.

Now you do not have any clue as to what trend                  is being followed in this dataset as you don’t know their names, colour or any other feature. Thus, you would put                  this into a learning approach-based AI machine and the machine would come up with various patterns it has                  observed in the features of these images. It might cluster the data on the basis of colour, size, shape, etc. It might                  also come up with some very unusual clustering algorithm which you might not have even thought of.

It               modifies itself based on data changes, ensuring adaptability and handling exceptions effectively.               For example, a learning-based product recommendation system is an AI model used by e-commerce platforms               like Amazon or Flipkart to suggest products to users based on their behaviour, preferences, and purchase               history. Unlike rule-based systems that suggest predefined items, this approach learns patterns and adapts to               users' interests over time.               The system is trained using a large dataset of user interactions, that includes browsing history, purchase history,               search queries and reviews/rating. The trained model analyses a user’s current activity in real time and matches it               with patterns learned during training. Using machine learning algorithms, the recommendation system identifies               shifts in user interests or seasonal preferences. This learning-based recommendation system enables e-commerce               platforms to offer a personalised shopping experience, boosting user satisfaction and business revenue.               The Learning-based Approach can further be divided into three sections:                                                          Learning-based Approach                            Supervised Learning              Unsupervised Learning              Reinforcement Learning                 Supervised Learning                 Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained               on a labelled dataset. A labelled dataset is the information which is tagged               with  identifiers  of  data.  Labels  are  the  key  component  in  supervised               learning,  as they guide the learning  process. A label is  an information               that can be used as the tag for data. For example, students in a class are               evaluated based on their performance in exams and assignments. Their               performance is categorised into labels such as \"Outstanding,\" \"Very Good,\"                \"Satisfactory,\" or \"Needs Improvement.\"               Supervised learning is like, how a teacher helps students learn. The teacher provides clear examples and guidance               (training data) to teach concepts. Later, the teacher tests the students' understanding with new questions (testing               data). Similarly, a supervised learning model uses labelled training data to learn patterns and then applies this               knowledge to make predictions on unseen data, improving its accuracy over time.                       186     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","Let’s take an example to understand Supervised Learning:                   Build a model to predict the type of fruit based on its weight and size.                  Assume that you have a dataset of fruits with their weights and sizes labelled:                      • Apple → Weight: 200 grams, Size: Medium                     • Banana → Weight: 120 grams, Size: Long                     • Orange → Weight: 150 grams, Size: Round                      • Grape → Weight: 5 grams, Size: Small                  Features of the data:                      • Weight: The mass of the fruit.                     • Size: The shape or dimension (e.g., medium, long, round, small).                  The  model  is  trained  with  labelled  data  where  the  weights  and  sizes  are  associated  with  specific  fruit  types.                  The model learns to recognise patterns and relationships between the features (weight and size) and the label                  (fruit type). So, if the trained model is given new data (e.g., Weight: 120 grams, Size: Long), it predicts the fruit                  type (Banana) based on the training it received. This example demonstrates how labelled data (weight, size, and                  corresponding fruit type) helps the model learn and make predictions for new instances.

This means that the data which is fed to the machine                  is random and there is no knowhow available about it to the model. The machine analyses the data and identifies                  patterns, structures, or relationships on its own without any guidance. The goal is to group or organise data based                  on similarities or differences.                   In this model the major features are identified by the machine, which help the user in understanding the data.                  For example, in the data of 100 cat images, if you want to understand some pattern in the data, you would need                  to feed this data into the unsupervised learning model and train the machine. Once trained, the machine would                  identify patterns in the data. These patterns might already be known to the user, like colour or size, or different                  features of the cats.                  Unsupervised learning helps discover hidden patterns in unlabelled data. For example, imagine a photo gallery                  app  that  automatically  organises  a  user's  photos  based  on  their  content.  The  photos  aren’t  pre-labelled  as                  \"family,\" \"vacation,\" \"pets,\" or \"friends.\" Instead, the app uses unsupervised learning to analyse the photos and                  group them based on similarities, such as recognising the same faces, landscapes, or objects like pets or vehicles.                                                                            Advanced Concepts of Modeling in AI   187","As a result, the app clusters the photos into categories like \"vacation,\" \"family gatherings,\" or \"pets,\" without               needing any input or labels from the user.               This example shows how unsupervised learning works by discovering hidden patterns in unlabelled data, just like               the child in the swimming pool explores and learns independently.               Let us take an example of the Unsupervised Learning - Fraud Detection:               A bank processes a large number of transactions daily, maintaining a database with details like:                •  Transaction amount               •  Transaction location               •  Time of transaction               •  Account activity patterns               The  goal  is  to  identify  potentially  fraudulent  transactions.  However,  the  transactions  are  not  pre-labelled  as               \"fraudulent\" or \"non-fraudulent.\"               An Unsupervised learning algorithm is applied to analyse the data and group transactions based on patterns.               The algorithm automatically identifies unusual behaviours, such as:                  • Unusually large transactions.                   • Purchases from unusual locations.                  • Multiple transactions within a short time frame.               The model forms two main clusters:                  • Cluster 1: Regular transactions that follow typical patterns.                   • Cluster 2: Suspicious transactions that deviate significantly from normal behaviour.               Based on these clusters, the bank can flag transactions in Cluster 2 for further investigation, without needing prior               labels for fraudulent activity.

Reinforcement Learning                Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where a model learns through trial and error to make the               best decisions in a given environment. It interacts with its surroundings, receiving rewards for correct actions and               penalties for mistakes, gradually improving over time. The goal is to maximise cumulative rewards by learning from               experience and adapting to new situations.               For example, a robot learning to walk starts with random movements. When it takes a correct step, it gets a reward;               if it falls, it receives a penalty. Over time, the model learns which movements keep it balanced and eventually walks               efficiently.               Let us take an example of Reinforcement Learning:                You show the machine an image of a ball and ask it to predict the object. Initially, the machine predicts it to be a               globe. Since this is incorrect, it receives negative feedback. The machine then adjusts its understanding and learns               that the object is not a globe. When the same image is provided again, the machine predicts it to be an orange.               This is also incorrect, so it receives negative feedback again.                                          Reinforcement Model     Globe                   Reinforcement Model    Orange                  Finally, after  multiple attempts and  adjustments, the machine predicts the object correctly  as a ball.

In video game                     AI, Reinforcement Learning allows agents (e.g., characters or bots) to learn optimal strategies by exploring                     the game environment, receiving rewards for achieving objectives, and penalties for failing, improving their                     performance over time.                                       2.  Car Parking: In car parking, Reinforcement Learning helps the car learn how to park properly by trying different                     ways, getting rewards when it parks correctly, and getting penalties if it makes a mistake like hitting something.                                         3.

Reinforcement Learning  is  unique because of its ability to handle situations where  traditional  methods like               supervised or unsupervised learning may fall short. In these approaches, you typically need a clear understanding               of the data and the problem you're solving. However, real-world scenarios often involve complex and dynamic               environments that are not fully understood, and data might be lacking in certain situations. Additionally, the               environment may change over time, requiring the system to adapt. Reinforcement Learning stands out because it               doesn't rely on extensive pre-existing knowledge or large datasets, allowing it to learn from interactions with the               environment and adapt to unforeseen circumstances, making it highly effective in dynamic \& uncertain settings.

Sub-categories of Supervised Learning Models                The Supervised Learning is further categorised as: Classification and Regression. Let us learn about these in               detail.                Classification                Classification  is  a  rule-based  AI  model.  It  is  a  systematic  grouping  of  observations  in  classes,  something  like               categorising plants, animals in different categories by biologists. In classification you teach the machine to perform               with labelled data. Testing data is then classified as one of the labels of the training dataset.               The algorithm is able to determine to which set a given data point belongs to, by means of a classification function               represented by the dotted line. The model classifies datasets according to the rules given to it.                         192     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","onion                                                                                     ginger                                   For example, if we want to train a model to identify if an image is of an onion or a ginger, we need to train it with                  multiple images of both onion and ginger along with their labels. The machine will then classify images on the                  basis of the labels and predict the correct label for testing data. Classification works on discrete dataset. Following                  are some examples of classification:                     • Image Classification: In this scenario the model would be trained on different categories of images. The model                    would learn the pattern as fed by the training test and would be able to categorise images into predefined                    categories based on the pixel values of the images. For example, when differenet image of raw, ripe and rotten                    bananas are fed into the model, the trained classification model would analyse the images and predict the most                    likely category raw banana, ripe banana or rotten banana.                           Ripe Banana  Ripe Banana  Raw Banana  Rotten Banana                            Ripe Banana                                                                   Classification                                                                      Model                                                                                              Raw Banana                            Raw Banana  Ripe Banana  Rotten Banana                             Rotten Banana  Ripe Banana  Rotten Banana                                Rotten Banana                                     Input                                                           Output                      • Email Spam Detection: In this scenario, the model is trained with the words in the email, information of the                    sender, precedence of links to classify the emails under “Spam” or “Not Spam”. The trained model would then                    analyse the emails and predict them as “Spam” or “Not Spam”. Similar models are being used to categorise calls                    and messages as “Spam”.

The trained model is now capable of predicting the weather                 based on the atmospheric conditions under the category of “Sunny”, “Rainy”, ”Cloudy”.

It is an example of a rule-based AI model. In regression,               the algorithm generates  a mapping function from the data,  as               shown by the solid line in the given graph. The green dots shown in               the graph are the data values and the solid line here represents the               mapping done for them. With the help of this mapping function, we               can predict the future data. For example, if we want to predict the               temperature of a day in a year, we can use past year’s temperature               for that day as training data and can predict it for the coming year.               Regression  is  a  mathematical  approach  to  find  a  relationship  between  two  or  more  variables.  It  works  with               continuous data. This can be used for weather forecasting, time series modelling, etc. In order to get the best fit               results, the distance between the line and data points should be minimum.               Let us see some examples of the Regression Model:                  • Income Prediction: Predict a person's annual income based on demographics. The model is trained with input                 features like age, education, hours per week, it can take value within a specific range. The output is a continuous                 value, annual income of a person.                  • House Price Prediction: The model predicts the selling price of a house based on the input features like size of                 the house, number of rooms, location, market price of the house, etc. The model predicts the price of the house                 based on features of the house.                  • Temperature Prediction: Temperature is a continuous variable, capable of taking any value within a given                 range. Regression models are ideal for predicting such continuous outcomes. This model estimates temperature                 based on input features such as humidity, wind speed, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, and prior temperature                 readings.                  • Car Price Prediction: This model estimates the  selling  price  of  a  car  using various  factors,  like fuel type,                 years  of  usage,  number  of  previous  owners,  distance  driven  (in  kilometers),  transmission  type  (manual  or                 automatic).               Since the model predicts a continuous value, i.e., the approximate price of the car based on the input data, it falls               under the category of regression models.                       194     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","Note, Continuous data includes values that can be measured and take any value within a range (e.g., height,                  temperature).

Let us discuss these in detail.                   Clustering                   Clustering is a machine learning approach where the machine partitions the dataset into different clusters or                  categories based on machine generated algorithms. The data fed to such a model is usually unlabelled or random                  and thus the developer feeds in the data directly into the                  machine and instructs it to build its own algorithm. The                         short hair people                  machine then forms a pattern or cluster based on training                        long hair people                  data and groups those that follow the same pattern. Like,                  Model  segregates  people  with  long  and  short  hair  and                  forms two clusters based on it as shown in the graph.                  The  best clustering  is the  one  that  minimises  the  error.                  Clustering works on discrete dataset. For example, if you                  have random data of insects  and reptiles, since  you are                  unable to find any meaningful pattern amongst them, you                  would  feed  their  data  into the  clustering  algorithm.  The                  algorithm would then analyse the data and divide them into                  clusters according to their similarities based on the trends noticed. The clusters are then given as the output.                                                                             Advanced Concepts of Modeling in AI   195","Model                                                               Clustering Model Training                           Unlabelled Data                                                     Clustering on the Basis of Type                Clustering – Example 1               Rohan is the owner  of daily needs departmental  store.  He wants  to improve his marketing  strategies by               grouping  customers  based  on  their  purchasing  behaviour.  The  dataset  contains  different  details  about  the               customers like age, purchasing power, and their annual expenditure (Money spent to buy from the store).               Your aim is to group the customers into clusters like:               a.  High income high spending patterns               b.  Young and low income customers with average spending patterns                c.  Middle aged customers with moderate spending patterns.               In this example clustering is used where the algorithm will analyse the data and group customers into clusters               based on similarities in their spending behaviour and income.               The outcome will be clusters under the following categories:                  • Cluster 1: High-income customers with high spending.                  • Cluster 2: Young customers with low spending.                   • Cluster 3: Middle-aged customers with moderate spending.               This is how clustering technique works. The clustering model will be able to identify clusters based on some               similarities or patterns which are not defined in the input. For example, age, purchasing power and the annual               amount spent on the purchases (in store) are the only features known, but clusters based on age and purchasing               power  have  been  grouped  together  and  given  as  output.  Once  the  clusters  are  made,  the  store  can  offer               personalised discounts or loyalty programs to high-value customers and target low-spending customers with               promotional offers to increase their spending.               Clustering – Example 2                Tiya’s hobby is listening to music. She likes to listen to K-pop and Jazz songs whereas she dislikes songs with slow               tempo and low bass. We have grouped all the songs that belong to the Jazz and K-pop category in one cluster               that she likes, while songs with slow tempo into another cluster. Now if she listens to a new song with slow tempo,               could you predict if she likes the song X or not?               This is how clustering works; the clustering model will be able to identify clusters based on some kind of similarity               or pattern which is not defined in the input. For example, the only two features tempo and bass of the song is               known, the clusters based on likes and dislikes have been grouped together to give the output.               Similar techniques are used by OTT platforms like Netflix/Hotstar for recommendations.                Difference between Classification and Clustering               Classification: It's a supervised learning technique that assigns data points to predefined categories or labels.               Labelled data is fed to the model. For example, classifying emails as \"Spam\" or \"Not Spam.\"                       196     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","Clustering: It is an unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points into clusters. The input                  data is unlabelled data. For example, grouping customers based on shopping behaviour to target personalised                  marketing.                   Association                   Association is an unsupervised learning method that is used to find interesting relationships or patterns among                  variables in a dataset. It is widely employed to identify relationships between items, sets frequently purchased                  items together in large databases, helping to analyse how items or events are related to each other.

The machine is given large amounts of               information, which helps it learn and improve on its own. These smart systems can even create their own rules.               There are two types of Deep Learning Models: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Network               (CNN).                Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)                 It is artificially created efficient computing systems designed to simulate the human brain. It includes machine               learning as part of Artificial Intelligence. An ANN in its training phase is capable of learning by recognising patterns               in data which is later used to generate the desired output.               ANN is made up of three basic layers – Input, Hidden and Output. The input layer accepts the inputs, the hidden               layer processes the inputs, and the output layer produces the result where each layer tries to learn from the               computed weights. It is the foundation of AI and is used to solve complex problems that are difficult for humans.               It consists of hardware or software that operates just like neurons of the human brain. Commercial application of               ANN is in solving complex signal processing, predictions or pattern recognition problems.                Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)                 The Convolutional Neural Network is part of the Neural Networks that is primarily used for image related tasks. It               extracts spatial features from data. It is used in Image classification (e.g., object detection), Medical imaging (e.g.,               tumor detection), Facial recognition, Autonomous vehicles, etc.                       198     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","What is Neural Network?                    Neural Networks are loosely modelled after how neurons in the human brain behave. The key advantage of Neural                  Networks is that they are able to extract data features automatically without needing the input of the programmer.                  A Neural Network is essentially a system of organising Machine Learning algorithms to perform certain tasks. It is                  a fast and efficient way to solve problems for which the data set is very large, such as in images.                   Neural Networks form a base of Deep Learning, a subfield of Machine Learning where algorithms are inspired by                  the structure of the human brain. Neural networks take in data, train themselves to recognise the patterns in this                  data and then predict the outputs for a new set of similar data. The most impressive aspect of Neural Networks is                  that once trained, they learn on their own just like human brains.                   Working of Neural Networks                   Neural Networks are made up of layers of neurons, just like the human brain that consists of millions of neurons.                  These neurons are the core processing units of the network. A Neural Network is divided into multiple layers.                  Each layer in Neural Network is further divided into several blocks called nodes. Each node has its own task to                  accomplish which is then passed to the next layer. These layers with their working are as follows:                  1.   Input Layer: The input layer is the first layer of a Neural Network. Its job is to receive raw data from the outside                     world and pass it into the network. No processing happens at this layer; it simply acts as a gateway for the data                     to enter the system.                  2.   Hidden Layers: The hidden layers come after the input layer where the actual processing happens. These                     layers are called \"hidden\" because they are not directly visible to the user.                        • Each node (or block) in a hidden layer performs a computation using weights and biases.                        • The data received from the input layer is processed by applying Machine Learning algorithms at each node.                         • After computation, the results are passed through an activation function, which determines whether the                       information should be forwarded to the next layer.                        • Over  multiple iterations,  the  network  adjusts the  weights  and  biases to  reduce  the  error  between  the                       predicted output and the desired output. This trial-and-error process helps the network learn and improve                       over time.                  3.  Output Layer: The output layer is the final layer of the Neural Network. It takes the processed information                     from the hidden layers and provides the final output, which could be a prediction, classification, or any other                     desired result based on the problem being solved.                  Real-world  applications  of  Neural  Networks  are  fraud  detection,  recommendation  system,  facial  recognition,                  chatbots and virtual assistant, vegetable price prediction, etc.                                     Brainy Fact                           The first chatbot, ELIZA, was created in 1966 by Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT. ELIZA was designed                         to simulate conversation using pattern matching and scripted responses. One of its most famous                         scripts,  DOCTOR, mimicked a Rogerian psychotherapist by responding to user input with                         open-ended questions.                         Although ELIZA was quite simple compared to modern AI chatbots, it laid the foundation for                         conversational AI and Natural Language Processing.                                                                                Advanced Concepts of Modeling in AI   199","How does AI make a Decision?                 A perceptron is a basic unit of an Artificial Neural Network that mimics a biological neuron. It takes multiple               inputs, applies weights, sums them, and passes the result through an activation function to produce an output.               It serves as a fundamental building block of neural networks, enabling AI to classify and distinguish between               different inputs based on learned patterns.               For example, let's say you want to go for a picnic to the park today. What would be your thought process? What               would you consider?               On a sunny day, many of us would love to play and enjoy good food in the park. These factors can influence your               decision about whether to go for a picnic or not. For example, you might ask yourself:                  • “Should I bring a cricket kit?”                      •  “Should I bring a Tambola game to play?”                   • \"Will there be a big playground to play Cricket?\"    •  “Will there be food outlets nearby?”               These questions help you plan your picnic and make the most of your day out.                                                                                         12 I N G O                                                                                 B  B I N G O                                                                                       B I N G O                                                                                         8                                                                                      8                                                                                               2                                                                                12  12 8  60 28  28 15  28 15 2  15                                                                                  60 67 39 26                                                                                60 67 39 67  39 26 9 26 9  9                                                                                    24                                                                                        FLAT                                                                                        FLAT                                                                                        BACKGROUND 47 63                                                                                          FLAT                                                                                24  24 1 11  11  11 BACKGROUND47 63  1                                                                                          BINGO                                                                                        BINGO                                                                                        BINGO                                                                                         BACKGROUND 47                                                                                      48                                                                                         38 22 5                                                                                  1  48 38 22  62                                                                                 1  26 48 38  22  5 5                                                                                     54                                                                                           13 77                                                                                  26 54                                                                                 26 54 62 62 62 13 13  77                                                                                 www.bingobackground.com                                                                                 www.bingobackground.com  77                                                                                www.bingobackground.com                                 Should I bring a cricket kit?

Will there be a big playground             Will there be food outlets nearby?                                      to play Cricket?               Now, you have the factors that will guide your decision on what to do during the picnic. But take note, not all               factors are equal. Some factors are more important, while some are not. Let's see which one is more important.               Let us rank them from the most important to the least important. For me, “Will there be big playground to play               cricket?” is more important than “Will there be food outlets nearby?”. And “Should I bring a cricket kit?” is more               important than “Should I bring a Tambola game to play?”. We can put the ranking for this example.                Now let us convert this to perceptron.               In the above example, we have four factors as four inputs. So, let’s draw the perceptron with four inputs (from X1               to X4). Next, we have their weights (from W1 to W4). Then, we also have the bias B, with weight W . Then, we sum                                                                                                         B               all up as weighted sum (Σ). Then, the weighted sum is passed through an activation function (∫). The activation               function is a rule that helps a neuron decide whether to pass its signal forward, allowing the model to handle               complex problems.

B                      Now, we will assign weights to the factors. The values assigned to weights can be based on experience or personal                  preference. For instance, someone who has experienced the fun of playing in a big playground at a picnic spot                  might assign greater importance to having a big ground, believing it allows more people to join and increases                  the enjoyment. On the other hand, personal preferences vary—someone who isn’t interested in physical activities                  might give less importance to a large ground.                  Similarly,  the value assigned to W   (weight  for  the  big  ground)  can  reflect  personal  choices  or  biases,  which                                                  B                  may outweigh the influence of all other factors. A person who enjoys physical sports might set a lower value for                                                                              Advanced Concepts of Modeling in AI   201","W , ensuring the decision leans towards playing Cricket unless they are certain the ground is small. Conversely,                 B               someone less inclined towards physical activities might assign a higher value to W , prioritising a game like Tambola                                                                                         B               regardless of the size of the picnic spot.

B                   The values of the weight can be anything and there is no right or wrong answer to it. However, whether they are               playing Cricket or Tambola will be determined by values that are chosen. This is the reason why everyone gets               different decisions, even though the situation/conditions are the same for everyone.                Scenario 1: In reality the ground is big, there are no food outlets around the place, we have the cricket kit and               we do not have tambola so, we assign YES or NO to the factors. We can convert the YES to 1 and NO to 0, and for               bias, we always take 1.

The fun of the game lies in playing it honestly.                        • Each layer must sit at a distance from the others.                        • The image is shown only to the Input layer and must not be shared with anyone else.                        • The game must be played silently. Players should write a word on a chit and pass it on without speaking                       aloud.                        • Process the data quickly—minimal time should be spent writing and passing chits.                        • Input layer nodes cannot discuss the image with each other. Each player must use their own discretion.                        • Only one word per chit is allowed—no sentences or multiple words.                        • Once a layer has completed its task, players must sit aside quietly and avoid disturbing others until the                       game ends.                     Game Instructions:                        • Input Layer:                          7 students will act as the nodes of the input layer.                         Each student will be shown an image and must carefully observe it.                          After viewing the image, each student will write 6 different words on 6 separate chits that best                           describe the image. Words can be repeated if necessary.                          Once the chits are ready, each student will pass one chit to each node of Hidden Layer 1, ensuring                           that every hidden layer node receives one chit from each input layer node.                        • Hidden Layer 1:                           6 students will be standing as the nodes of hidden layer 1.                           Each of them will receive 7 chits from 7 different input nodes. Now they have to take a good look at                          the chits and then write down 4 different words on 4 different chits. For this, they can either use the                          same words as the input layer did, or they can make their own information (relevant to the context)                          and write it.                           Now these 4 chits are to be given randomly to any 4 nodes of Hidden Layer 2. Out of the 6 nodes of                          2nd hidden layer, one can choose any 4 and give once chit to each. (For best results, each node of                          hidden layer 2 should get almost same number of chits thus the division should be done properly)                        • Hidden Layer 2:                           6 students will be standing as the nodes of hidden layer 2.                           Each one of them will get some number of chits from the previous layer. Now they have to perform                          the same task as hidden layer 1 and have to write down 2 different words on 2 different chits and                          pass it on to the output layer.                        • Output Layer:                           Finally the output layer node will get 12 chits. Now s/he has to understand all the words and has to                          guess which image was shown to the input layer initially.                            Output layer will then write a summary out of all the words received to explain his/her deduction.                          The summary should not be more than 5 lines.                        • Finally, the output layer presents this summary in-front of everyone and the real image is finally revealed                       to all. If the summary is accurate enough, the whole network wins, else they lose.La venimus ni repta                       doluptiae cum as sit latentiis dolut eum, que sedi as non con et essequide voluptur?                        • Dolorerferum sandi audigent utet eum sita niminve ntiusa ant etur sam re, simint.                                                                               Advanced Concepts of Modeling in AI   205","At a Glance                       • Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a fast-growing technology that allows machines to do tasks that usually need human                     intelligence, like learning, solving problems, and making decisions.                     • ML stands for Machine Learning, which is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. It uses statistical methods to enable                     machines to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed                     • DL stands for Deep Learning. It is a subset of Machine Learning inspired by the structure and function of neurons                     in the human brain, leading to the development of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).                     • Marked or tagged data, which easily identifiable is called labelled data.                     • Data that is not marked/tagged is called unlabelled data.                     • A collection of data provided to a machine learning model to help it analyse and learn patterns is called training data.                     • The testing data set is a collection of data provided to a machine learning model to evaluate how well it has learned                     to make predictions.                     • AI Modelling refers to developing algorithms, also called models which can be trained to get intelligent outputs.                     That is, writing codes to make a machine artificially intelligent. The model is trained using data.                     • Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained on a labelled dataset.                     • Unsupervised learning approach works on an unlabelled dataset. The machine receives random data with no prior                     knowledge available to the trainer.                     • Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where a model learns through trial and error to make the                     best decisions in a given environment.                     • Classification is a rule-based AI model that groups data into categories                     • Regression algorithms predict continuous values (e.g., income, house price, temperature, car price).                     • Clustering is a machine learning technique that divides a dataset into distinct clusters or categories using algorithmic                     patterns.                     • Association is an unsupervised learning method that is used to find interesting relationships or patterns among                     variables in a dataset.                     • Neural Networks are loosely modelled after how neurons in the human brain behave. The key advantage of Neural                     Networks is that they are able to extract data features automatically without needing the input of the programmer.

The difference between ML and DL are as follows:                         Parameters                  Machine Learning                           Deep Learning                                       Machine Learning algorithm can easily work with   When the size of the data is small, a Deep                        Data           smaller data set.

Machine Learning algorithms can work on low                        Hardware                                                  Deep Learning algorithms are heavily dependent                                       end machines as well.                        Dependency                                                on high-end machines.                                       When we are solving a problem using a      Deep Learning algorithm solves the problem                                       traditional machine learning algorithm it is   end to end.                        Problem        generally recommended that we first break down                        Solving        the problem into different sub parts and solve                        Approach       them individually and then finally combine them                                       to get the desired result.

How does Neural Networks work?                    Ans.  Neural Networks are made up of layers of neurons, just like the human brain that consists of millions of neurons. These                        neurons are the core processing units of the network. A Neural Network is divided into multiple layers. Each layer in                        Neural Network is further divided into several blocks called nodes. Each node has its own task to accomplish which is                        then passed to the next layer. These layers with their working are as follows:                                                    INPUT                     HIDDEN                     OUTPUT                                 LAYER                      LAYERS                     LAYER                         a.  Input Layer: The input layer is the first layer of a Neural Network. Its job is to receive raw data from the outside                          world and pass it into the network. No processing happens at this layer; it simply acts as a gateway for the data to                          enter the system.                                                                           Advanced Concepts of Modeling in AI   209","b.  Hidden Layers: The hidden layers come after the input layer and are where the actual processing happens. These                        layers are called \"hidden\" because they are not directly visible to the user.                       • Each node (or block) in a hidden layer performs a computation using weights and biases.                       • The data received from the input layer is processed by applying Machine Learning algorithms at each node.                       •  After  computation,  the  results  are  passed  through  an  activation  function,  which  determines  whether  the                          information should be forwarded to the next layer.                       •  Over multiple iterations, the network adjusts the weights and biases to reduce the error between the predicted                          output and the desired output. This trial-and-error process helps the network learn and improve over time.                      c.   Output Layer: The output layer is the final layer of the Neural Network. It takes the processed information from the                        hidden layers and provides the final output, which could be a prediction, classification, or any other desired result                        based on the problem being solved.                   3.  Differentiate between labelled and unlabelled dataset.                  Ans.  The difference between labelled and unlabelled dataset are:                     Labelled Data: Marked or tagged data, which easily identifiable is called labelled data. For example, name, type,                     colour, etc.                     Unlabelled Data: Data that is not marked/tagged is called unlabelled data. It is also known as the raw form of data.                    4.  What is Rule-based Approach? Write any one drawback of it.                 Ans.  The Rule-based Approach is one of the earliest and simplest methods of implementing artificial intelligence. It relies on                     predefined rules and facts created by developers to enable machines to perform specific tasks and generate desired                     outputs. Developers manually define a set of rules that determine how the machine processes data and responds to                     various scenarios.                     The main drawback of this approach is that the machine's learning is static. Once trained, the machine does not adapt                     to changes made in the original training dataset. If the machine is tested on a dataset that differs from the rules and                     data provided during the training stage, it will fail to produce accurate results and will not learn or adjust to the new                     conditions it encounters.                   5.  Explain the term clustering. Give an example.                 Ans.  Clustering is a machine learning approach where the machine partitions the dataset into different clusters or categories                     based on machine generated algorithms. The data fed to such a model is usually unlabelled or random and thus the                     developer feeds in the data directly into the machine and instructs it to build its own algorithm. The machine then                     forms a pattern or cluster based on training data and groups those that follow the same pattern.                     The best clustering is the one that minimizes the error. Clustering works on discrete dataset. For example, if you have                     random data of insects and reptiles, since you are unable to find any meaningful pattern amongst them, you would                     feed their data into the clustering algorithm. The algorithm would then analyse the data and divide them into clusters                     according to their similarities based on the trends noticed. The clusters are then given as the output.                   6.  Explain Unsupervised Learning approach with an example.                 Ans.  Unsupervised learning approach works on an unlabelled dataset. This means that the data which is fed to the machine                     is random and there is no knowhow available about it to the model. The machine analyses the data and identifies                     patterns, structures, or relationships on its own without any guidance. The goal is to group or organise data based on                     similarities or differences.                     In this model the major features are identified by the machine, which help the user in understanding the data. For                     example, in the data of 100 cat images, if you want to understand some pattern in the data, you would need to feed this                     data into the unsupervised learning model and train the machine. Once trained, the machine would identify patterns                     in the data. These patterns might already be known to the user, like colour or size, or different features of the cats.                   7.  How does Video Game AI demonstrate Reinforcement Learning?                 Ans.  A video game character (AI) learns to play a game like chess, Go, or Atari games. In video game AI, Reinforcement                     Learning  allows  agents  (e.g.,  characters  or  bots)  to  learn  optimal  strategies  by  exploring  the  game  environment,                     receiving rewards for achieving objectives, and penalties for failing, improving their performance over time.                      210     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","8.  Explain any two examples of Regression Model.                    Ans.  Let us see some examples of the Regression Model:                        •   Income Prediction: Predict a person's annual income based on demographics. The model is trained with input                          features like age, education, hours per week, meaning it can take value within a specific range. The output is a                          continuous value, annual income of a person.                        •   House Price Prediction: The model predicts the selling price of a house based on the input features like size of the                          house, number of rooms, location, market price of the house, etc. The model predicts the price of the house based                          on features of the house.

After the designing of an AI model, it is important to evaluate the model to see that the model is designed as per                  the need and is giving the desired process.                            Understanding Evaluation                    It is the evaluation phase of the AI project cycle, where we check whether the model can achieve required goals or                  not. If the model fails to meet the requirements, we can modify either the model or the data. Once the developer                  feels it is deployed in a real-world environment and handed over to the user. If the deployment stage is not                  reached, the project is of no use.                                                                                                                      Evaluating Models    221","Importance of Model Evaluation                Model evaluation is the process of applying various metrics to assess a machine learning model’s performance.               AI model improves overtime with constructive feedback. This is an iterative process where you build the model,               evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics, refine it based on the feedback, and repeat until the desired               accuracy is achieved. It’s similar to tuning a musical instrument—regularly checking its sound quality, making               adjustments, and fine-tuning until the melody is harmonious and meets the desired standard.                                       Some of the advantages of evaluating a model are as follows:                  • Evaluation ensures that the model is operating correctly and optimally.                   • Evaluation is an initiative to understand how well it achieves its goals.                  • Evaluation helps to determine what works well and what could be improved in a program.

It  helps  identify  its  strengths,  pinpoint               weaknesses, and determine how well it fits the task at hand. This feedback acts as a guide to refine and improve               the model, making it more reliable and trustworthy. The process is continuous, just like fine-tuning a skill to               achieve the best results. Depending upon the type and the purpose of the evaluation model, there are different               types of evaluation techniques, like Train-Test split, Confusion Matrix, etc.                          Splitting the Training Set Data for Evaluation                Splitting the training set data is a crucial step in model evaluation, allowing for a systematic assessment of the               model’s performance by creating distinct datasets for training, validation, and testing. Let’s learn more about               splitting the training set using the Train-Test split in detail.                       222     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","Train-Test Split                   It’s a model evaluation technique that reveals how the model performs on new data. This technique is used in                  machine learning algorithms to evaluate the performance of the model by dividing the dataset into two subsets,                  the Training subset and the Testing subset. The train-test procedure is appropriate when there is a sufficiently                  large dataset available.                   Training subset is used for model training, where it learns patterns from the data. Typically, this subset comprises                  70% to 80% of the dataset. Testing subset is used to evaluate the model's generalisation ability on unseen data. It                  typically consists of 20% to 30% of the dataset.                                                                                       10000 labelled                                                                                   data for image                                                    Testing set                  classification model                                                     Training set                                                                     7000 labelled data        3000 labelled data                                                                     used for training          used for testing                      Need of Train-Test Split                   The training dataset is used to make the model learn how to recognise patterns and relationships in the data. Once                  the model is trained, the test dataset is used to evaluate its performance. The inputs from the test set are given                  to the model, which makes predictions. These predictions are then compared with the actual expected results.                  The goal is to understand how well the model can perform on new, unseen data that wasn’t part of the training                  process. It provides an unbiased estimate of performance of the machine learning model in real world scenarios                  and ensures the model can perform efficiently on the unseen data, rather than on the trained data.

This involves feeding the data into the algorithm, which                 learns patterns and relationships to create a model.                   • The trained model is tested or applied using testing data, ensuring that the model generalises well to unseen                 data.                  • The ML algorithm processes the input data and provides a prediction or result.

Evaluation Techniques                 Evaluation techniques involve assessing a machine learning model’s performance on training and test data. The               three types of evaluation techniques are given below:                                       Overfitting                           Underfitting                     Perfect Fit               (forcefitting- too good to be true)   (too simple to explain)            (captures data trends and                                                                                      generalises well.)                The description of these evaluation models is as follows:               1.   Overfitting Model: The model (red curve) fits the training data perfectly, including noise, but performs poorly                  on the testing data, leading to poor generalisation. In overfitting, the model is too complex and performs well                  on training data but poorly on test data. It has low bias and high variance. The model memorizes the training                  data but struggles to generalise to new, unseen data.               2.   Underfitting Model: The model (purple line) is too simplistic, failing to capture the pattern in both the training                  and testing data. It has high bias and low variance. The model fails to capture the underlying patterns in the                  data.               3.   Perfect Fit Model: The model (green curve) balances complexity and generalisation, fitting the training data                  well and performing well on the testing data. It performs well on both training and test data and generalises                  effectively to new data.                       224     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","Reboot                          1.  What are the types of evaluation techniques?                          2.  What characterises a model experiencing underfitting?                                Accuracy and Error                    Let’s consider a scenario where, Aman and Priya went grocery shopping to buy a bag of 5 kg rice. Aman got `450                  and Priya got `500. The actual price of the rice was `550.                     • Who is more accurate? Aman or Priya?                    Priya was more accurate, as her estimate is closer to the actual price.                     • How much is the error for both Aman and Priya in estimating the price of a bag of rice?                    Error is the difference between the measured value and true value.                    Aman’s Error is `100 (550-400)                    Priya’s Error is `50 (550-500)                    Here, Priya is more accurate as her error is less than Aman’s error.                  The term Accuracy is defined as the evaluation metric that measures the total number of predictions that are                  correct by the model. It means how close the prediction is to the true value. The accuracy of the model and the                  performance of the model is directly proportional, which means better the performance of the model,  leads to                  higher accuracy in predictions.                  The term Error means the action that is inaccurate or wrong. It refers to the difference between a model’s prediction                  and the actual outcome. It quantifies how often the model makes mistakes. Based on the error, we choose the                  machine learning model that has the best performance for a specific dataset. Low error in a model 's performance                  signifies precise and reliable predictions.

Evaluation Metrics for Classification                     Classification is a type of supervised learning in machine learning where the goal is to predict the categorical label                  or class of a given input based on historical data. In classification tasks, the model is trained on a labelled dataset,                  where a specific type of class label is the result to be predicted from the given input field of data. The model learns                  to map inputs to the correct category during the training phase.                   What is Classification?                   Classification is the task of “classifying things” into sub-categories. Classification is part of supervised machine                  learning in which we put labelled data for training.                  For  example,  You  and  your  friends  go  to  a  restaurant,  where  pure  vegetarians  sit  together  at  one  table  and                  non-vegetarians sit together at another table, to ensure that there is no confusion while serving food.                                    So basically, you are classifying your friends into two categories:                     • Pure vegetarians                     • Non-vegetarians                                         CLASSIFICATION IN MACHINE LEARNING                                                                                                      Vegetarian                                                                                            Non-vegetarian                                                                                            Eggetarian                                                                                            Vegan                                             4 Classes                 2 Classes                                                                                               Evaluating Models    227","Classification usually refers to categorisation of a specific class label that needs to be predicted from the given               input field of data as a result. For example, here we are working on a pure vegetarian service model that predicts               whether the item served is for a pure vegetarian or for all.                Classification Metrics                When evaluating a classification model, it’s important to measure its performance using various metrics. These               metrics help assess how well the model predicts the correct classes. Here are some popular metrics used for               classification models:                   • Confusion matrix                  • Classification accuracy                  • Precision                  • Recall                         Confusion Matrix                 A confusion matrix is a performance evaluation tool used in machine learning to assess the performance of               a classification model. It is a tabular representation that compares the actual labels (true outcomes) with the               predicted labels (model predictions). The table is made with 4 different combinations of predicted and actual               values in the form of 2×2 matrix. The comparison between the prediction and the reality can be used to evaluate               the rate of success. It also gives a clear picture of which classes are being predicted correctly and incorrectly, and               the types of errors are being made.               This matrix is also known as the Error Matrix and is used in situations where we need to evaluate the performance               of the model, identify errors, and find ways to improve the efficiency of the model.

Evaluating Models    229","Build the Confusion Matrix                To build the confusion matrix, we manually compare the predicted labels with the actual labels and categorise the               results into True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, and False Negatives.               For example, predicting the possibility of snowfall. Here, Yes would mean there will be snowfall, and No would               mean that there will be no snowfall. So, the AI model will have output as Yes or No.               The following table shows the actual values and the predicted values:                                                   Predicted Value        Actual Value                                                        Yes                   Yes                                                        No                    Yes                                                        Yes                   No                                                        No                    No                                                        Yes                   Yes                                                        Yes                   No                                                        No                    Yes                                                        Yes                   Yes                                                        No                    No                                                        No                    No                 Let’s fill the given matrix based on the table given here.

It provides a clear picture of how accurate the predictions are for the given model. A high accuracy score                  generally indicates good performance, as it accounts for all correctly predicted values. The mathematical formula                  for classification accuracy is:                                                                    No. of correct predictions                                         Classification Accuracy =                           × 100                                                                    Total no. of predictions                  Where,                   Total Correct Predictions = True Positive (TP) + True Negative (TN)                  Total Predictions = True Positive (TP) + True Negative (TN) + False Positive (FP) + False Negative (FN)                  A prediction is said to be correct if it matches reality.

It is suitable wherever the dataset is balanced, which means the positive and negative classes are roughly equal, that               is a rare occurrence, and that all predictions and prediction errors are equally important, which is often not the case.               For example, Calculating the accuracy of the classifier model, that predicts whether a student will pass a test               (Yes) or not pass a test (No). It classifies the input into two classes Yes and No. Let's, calculate the accuracy of the               classifier model and construct the confusion matrix for the model.               Here,                  • Total test data is 1000.                   • Actual values are 900 Yes and 100 No (Unbalanced dataset).                  • It is a faulty model which, irrespective of any input, will give a prediction as Yes.                  • Calculate the classification accuracy of this model.               To prepare the classification accuracy of this model follow the given steps:                 Step 1    Construct the Actual value vs Predicted value table. Consider Yes as the positive class and No as the                         negative class.

So, the faulty model will predict all the 1000 input data as Yes.                            Consider Yes as the positive class and No as the negative class. Construct the confusion matrix from the                        Actual vs Predicted table.

Does this make sense? So, in cases of unbalanced data, we                  should use other metrics such as Precision, Recall or F1 score.                            Precision                    Precision is the ratio of True Positive cases to All predicted positive cases.

It  would  take  into  consideration  all  the  Positive  conditions,  which  are  True  Positive  (Prediction  =  Yes  and                  Actual = Yes) and False Positive (Prediction = Yes and Actual = No). Here residents would always be anxious to find                  out if there will be snowfall or not and keep verifying if the prediction is TRUE or FALSE.                  Importantly, If False Positives are significantly higher than True Positives, then Precision will be low, if there are                  more False Predictions, the residents might become laid back, and might not check it more often, considering that                  the snowfall will not happen.                  Thus, Precision of the model is an important aspect for evaluation. So, if the Precision is more, that would mean                  that False Positive cases are less than the True Positive cases.                  So, if the model is 100% precise, it means that whenever the model predicts a snowfall (True Positive), the snowfall                  would definitely happen. There can be rare exceptional situations where the model would not be able to predict                  the snowfall, but the snowfall is there which will be a case of False Negative. In this case the Precision value does                  not get affected, as the False Negative is not considered by the model for the evaluation. Which raises a question:                  Is Precision a good parameter for performance of the model?

Which Metric is more Important—Recall or Precision?                    • Cases where cost of False Negative > False Positive:                  ○   Can be riskier and more unfavourable, as nobody expected snowfall and there was no Prediction also but still                     snowfall was there.                  ○   Can be costly and harmful, as when no rain is predicted and the farmers did not start the harvest as they                     thought that since no rain is predicted so their wheat crop which is ready to harvest can be done in a day or                     two. The model that was supposed to predict the rain but did not do so spoiled the whole crop.                      236     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","○   Can be alarming, as when AI model is used to predict COVID-19 cases in a residential society, it predicts                       False Negative i.e. few are infected. Therefore, the society will not be declared as a containment zone thus                       becoming a reason for sudden rise in COVID-19 cases in that residential society.                     • Cases where cost of False Positive > False Negative:                     ○   One  such  case  is  looking  for  a  missing  pet  in  the  nearby  jungle.  Imagine  a  model  telling  you  that  the                       pet—dog exists in the nearby jungle and you keep on going inside the jungle with all support team but it                       turns out that it is a false alarm.                     ○   Model that predicts whether a mail is spam or not. If the model always predicts that the mail is spam, people                       would not look at it and eventually might lose important information. Missing some important mail might                       create a problem.                  Based on different examples we can say, that both Recall and Precision are important. In some cases, you might                  have a High Precision but Low Recall or Low Precision but High Recall. So, we need an important measure that                  considers  both  Recall  and  Precision  for the  good  and accurate performance of  an  AI  model.  This  problem  is                  resolved by considering F1 Score.                           F1 Score                    F1 score, also called F-score or F-measure, is a metric used to evaluate the accuracy of a test. It can be defined                  as the measure of balance between precision and recall. The F1 score ranges between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates                  perfect Precision and Recall, and 0 indicates a complete failure.                  A high F1 score means the model has low False Positives (FP) and low False Negatives (FN)—meaning it correctly                  identifies real cases and minimizes false alarms. It is particularly useful in real-life classification problems, especially                  when dealing with imbalanced datasets (where one class is much more frequent than the other).                                                                      Precision × Recall                                                      F1 Score = 2 ×                                                                     Precision + Recall                   A model is said to have a good performance if the F1 Score for that model is high.                  An ideal situation occurs when both Precision and Recall have value as 1 i.e., 100%, then F1 score would also be an                  ideal 1 (100%). It is also known as the perfect value for F1 Score.                  A model is considered to be a total failure when the F1 score is 0.                  As the values of both Precision and Recall range from 0 to 1, the F1 score also ranges from 0 to 1.                   The different possibility of the F1 Score is:                     • If Precision = Low and Recall = Low then F1 Score will be Low.                     • If Precision = Low and Recall = High then F1 Score will be Low.                     • If Precision = High and Recall = Low then F1 Score will be Low.                     • If Precision = High and Recall = High then F1 Score will be High.                   CASE STUDY: Availability of School Transport                    In schools, a lot of times it happens that there is no transport facility available to commute. Such unavailability of                  school transport is a very common and prominent problem. Hence an AI model is designed to predict if there is                  going to be school transport available or not.

For example, a                  model might favor one gender, race, or socio-economic group over another. To prevent this, metrics should be                  carefully designed to avoid introducing or perpetuating bias.                      238     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","• Fairness - Fairness ensures that models treat all groups equally. The evaluation processes must account for                    fairness to prevent models from producing discriminatory results.                     • Transparency - Sometimes, evaluation models lack clarity, making it difficult to understand how predictions are                    made. A transparent approach clearly explains how metrics are chosen and how results are derived.                     • Accountability - It is crucial to take responsibility for the choice of evaluation metrics and their outcomes.                    Providing clear reasoning behind metric selection helps ensure ethical decision-making and builds trust.                     • Privacy - Using real-world data for evaluation often involves sensitive personal information, raising concerns                    about privacy. Measures should be in place to ensure that individual data is protected during the evaluation                    process.                     • Data Protection - Protecting the data used in model evaluation is essential to prevent misuse or unauthorised                    access.                                                                                                21 st  Century   #Media Literacy                                                                                                  Skills                            Video Session                         Watch the video on \"Precision, Recall, F1 score, True Positive\" at the given link:                       https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2osIZ-dSPGE or scan the QR code and answer  the                       following question:                       What did you learn about model evaluation from the video?

Why is it important to maintain a balance between bias and variance in a machine learning model?                 Ans.  It’s important to maintain a balance between bias and variance in machine learning model to ensure the model performs                     consistently on both training and test data.                   2.  Where should we use recall?                 Ans.  Recall is generally used for unbalanced dataset, when dealing with the False Negatives become important and the                     model needs to reduce the FNs as much as possible.                    3.  What is the primary benefit of using the Train-Test Split technique in model evaluation?                 Ans.  The primary benefit of using the Train-Test Split technique in model evaluation is that it gives an unbiased estimate of                     model performance on new data.                   4.  What is the significance of the False Negative (FN) in a confusion matrix?                 Ans.  A False Negative (FN) indicates that the model incorrectly predicted a negative outcome, even though the actual                     outcome was positive. It can be critical in scenarios like medical diagnosis.                   5.  How does classification accuracy differ when the dataset is unbalanced?                 Ans.  When the dataset is unbalanced, classification accuracy can be misleading, as the model may predict the majority class                     correctly but fail on the minority class.                             242     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","B.  Long answer type questions.                      1.  Explain the concept of a confusion matrix and its components. How is it used to evaluate a classification model?                    Ans.  A confusion matrix is a performance evaluation tool used in machine learning to summarieshe performance of a                        classification model. It is a tabular representation that compares the actual labels (true outcomes) with the predicted                        labels (model predictions). The table is made with 4 different combinations of predicted and actual values in the form                        of 2×2 matrix.                        To understand the confusion matrix, let’s understand the following terms:                        •  Positive: The prediction is positive for the scenario. For example, if there will be snowfall.                        •  Negative: The prediction is negative for the scenario. For example, there will be no snowfall.                        •   True  Positive:  The  predicted  value  matches  the  actual  value  i.e.;  the  actual  value  was  positive  and  the  model                          predicted a positive value.                        •   True Negative: The predicted value matches the actual value i.e.; the actual value was negative and the model                          predicted a negative value.                        •   False Positive (Type 1 error): The predicted value was falsely predicted i.e.; the actual value was negative but the                          model predicted a positive value.                        •   False Negative (Type 2 error): The predicted value was falsely predicted i.e.; the actual value was positive but the                          model predicted a negative value.                      2.   Lists the different evaluation model.                    Ans.  Evaluation techniques involve assessing a machine learning model’s performance on training and test data.                        The description of these evaluation models is as follows:                        •   Overfitting Model: The model (red curve) fits the training data perfectly, including noise, but performs poorly                          on the testing data, leading to poor generalisation. In overfitting, the model is too complex and performs well on                          training data but poorly on test data. It has low bias and high variance. The model memorizes the training data but                          struggles to generalize to new, unseen data.                        •   Underfitting Model: The model (purple line) is too simplistic, failing to capture the pattern in both the training and                          testing data. It has high bias and low variance. The model fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data.                        •   Perfect Fit Model: The model (green curve) balances complexity and generalisation, fitting the training data well                          and performing well on the testing data. It performs well on both training and test data and generalizes effectively                          to new data.                        •   Model  Selection:  Splitting  helps  compare  models  and  choose  the  best  one  based  on  performance  on  the                          testing set.                     3.  What is the purpose of using Precision and Recall together when evaluating a classification model, and how does the                        F1 Score help in balancing them?                     Ans.  Precision and Recall are used together to evaluate how well a model handles both false positives and false negatives.                        Precision focuses on how many of the predicted positive cases were actually positive, while Recall measures how many                        of the actual positive cases were correctly identified by the model.                        The F1 Score is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall. It helps balance these two metrics by giving a single value                        that combines both, making it particularly useful when the costs of false positives and false negatives are important                        and need to be minimized equally. F1 Score is often preferred when there's a need to strike a balance between Precision                        and Recall rather than focusing on one over the other.                     4.  What do you understand by accuracy and error in evaluation metrics?                    Ans.  The term Accuracy is defined as the evaluation metric that measures the total number of predictions that are correct                        by the model. It means how close the prediction is to the true value. The accuracy of the model and the performance                        of the model is directly proportional, that means better the performance of the model, higher is the accuracy of the                        predictions.                                                                                             Evaluating Models    243","The term Error means the action that is inaccurate or wrong. It refers to the difference between a model’s prediction                     and the actual outcome. It quantifies how often the model makes mistakes. Based on the error, we choose the machine                     learning model that has the best performance for a specific dataset. Low Error in a model performance signifies precise                     and reliable predictions.                   5.  Discuss the ethical concerns around model evaluation.                 Ans.  The following are the ethical concerns in the model evaluation:                      •   Bias: Evaluation metrics may fail to detect biases in a model, leading to unfair outcomes. For example, a model might                        favor one gender, race, or socio-economic group over another. To prevent this, metrics should be carefully designed                        to avoid introducing or perpetuating bias.                      •   Fairness: Fairness ensures that models treat all groups equally. The evaluation processes must account for fairness                        to prevent models from producing discriminatory results.                      •   Transparency: Sometimes, evaluation models lack clarity, making it difficult to understand how predictions are made.                        A transparent approach clearly explains how metrics are chosen and how results are derived.                      •   Accountability: It is crucial to take responsibility for the choice of evaluation metrics and their outcomes. Providing                        clear reasoning behind metric selection helps ensure ethical decision-making and builds trust.                      •   Privacy: Using real-world data for evaluation often involves sensitive personal information, raising concerns about                        privacy. Measures should be in place to ensure that individual data is protected during the evaluation process.                      •  Data Protection: Protecting the data used in model evaluation is essential to prevent misuse or unauthorised access.

A company is developing a model to predict whether a customer will default on a loan. If the dataset is not split                        properly into training and testing sets, what issues might arise? How would you ensure fair evaluation?                    Ans. If the dataset is not split properly, the model might overfit, learning patterns from the training data but failing to                       generalize to new data. This leads to poor performance on real-world predictions. To ensure fair evaluation, the dataset                       should be split into a training set (for learning patterns) and a testing set (for evaluating generalisation). Sometimes, a                       validation set is also used for hyperparameter tuning.                     3.  Identify which metric (Precision or Recall) is to be used in the following cases and why?                        a.  Email Spam Detection                         b.  Cancer Diagnosis                        c.  Legal Cases(Innocent until proven guilty)                        d.  Fraud Detection                        e.  Safe Content Filtering (like Kids YouTube)                    Ans. a.   Precision: In spam detection, you generally want to minimise the number of legitimate emails incorrectly marked                          as spam (False Positives). Precision is important here because it focuses on the accuracy of the positive predictions,                          ensuring that when the model predicts an email is spam, it truly is spam.                       b.   Recall: In cancer diagnosis, it's crucial to identify all the true cancer cases, even if it means some healthy people are                          wrongly identified as having cancer (False Positives). Recall is more important here because it focuses on identifying                          all actual positive cases (patients with cancer), which is critical to avoid missing any true positive cases.                       c.   Precision: In a legal setting, particularly with the principle of \"innocent until proven guilty,\" you want to minimize the                          number of innocent people wrongly convicted (False Positives). Precision is important here because it ensures that                          when a legal case is predicted to be guilty, the defendant is actually guilty.                       d.   Recall: In fraud detection, it's important to catch all instances of fraud, even at the risk of flagging some legitimate                          transactions as fraudulent. Recall is prioritized because missing out on fraudulent transactions (False Negatives)                          can have significant consequences, whereas false alarms (False Positives) can usually be dealt with through further                          verification.                       e.   Precision: For safe content filtering, you want to ensure that all flagged content is indeed inappropriate (False                          Positives are more costly). Precision is key here because it focuses on making sure that when content is flagged as                          unsafe, it truly is unsafe.

Direction: Questions 2-4, consist of two statements – Assertion (A) and Reasoning (R). Answer these questions by selecting                     the appropriate option given below:                         a. Both A and R are correct, and R is the correct explanation of A.                        b. Both A and R are correct, but R is NOT the correct explanation of A.                        c. A is correct, but R is incorrect.                        d. A is incorrect, but R is correct.                      2.  Assertion (A): A model with high accuracy always performs well on all types of classification problems.                        Reasoning(R): Accuracy is a reliable metric for evaluating model  performance in all scenarios.                     3.  Assertion (A): Bias in training  data  can lead  to unfair predictions in AI models.                        Reasoning (R): If  the training  dataset  lacks diversity, the model  may  learn and reinforce existing biases.                     4.  Assertion (A): Accuracy is an evaluation metric that allows you to measure the total number of predictions a model                        gets right.                        Reasoning (R): The accuracy of the model and performance of the model is directly proportional, and hence better the                        performance of the model, the more accurate are the predictions.

AI systems use large amounts of data to “learn” through algorithms, allowing machines to do tasks that               usually need human intelligence. The success of AI depends on the type, quality, and amount of data it receives.               Depending on the data and the tasks the AI is made to do, AI can be divided into three main domains: Data               Science, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing (NLP).                          What is Data Science?                 Data Science is a continuous process of exploring and discovering new things by analysing data. It helps us find               patterns, trends, and insights that allow us to better understand the world. At its core, Data Science takes raw data               and turns it into valuable knowledge using a mix of statistics, computer techniques, and specialised knowledge               from different fields.               Data Science itself is an interdisciplinary field that integrates various aspects of statistics, data analysis, machine               learning, and other related methodologies. Its purpose is to extract meaningful insights from data and apply them               to solve real-world problems. To achieve this, data scientists use a diverse range of techniques drawn from fields               like Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, and Information Science, all of which contribute to the development               of models, algorithms, and tools that enhance data-driven decision-making.               In  essence,  Data  Science  serves  as  the  backbone  of  AI,  bridging  the  gap  between  raw  data  and  actionable               intelligence, while providing the foundation for AI systems to learn, adapt, and improve over time.               For example, imagine a company that sells online clothing. The company collects data about customers’ purchasing               habits, such as what items they buy, when they buy them, and what discounts they use. A data scientist can analyse               this data to find patterns, such as which items are most popular during certain seasons or how certain discounts               affect sales. Using these insights, the company can make data-driven decisions like adjusting their marketing               strategy, predicting demand, or creating personalised offers for customers.                           252     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","In this example, Data Science helps the company better understand their business and improve their operations,                  making it a valuable tool for decision-making.

Applications of Data Science                   Data Science is used in various fields for different purposes. Let us discuss some of its applications in detail.                   Internet Search                   One of the most common applications of Data Science is in Internet search engines, such as Google. When you                  type a question or keyword into the search bar, the search engine employs Data Science algorithms to deliver                  the most relevant and useful results within seconds. These algorithms analyse vast amounts of data, including                  website content, past search trends, and user behaviour, to determine which web pages should be displayed                  first. For example, Google processes an enormous amount of data—more than 20 petabytes (which is 20 million                  gigabytes) of data every day. Without Data Science, Google wouldn’t be as effective at delivering these results.                                                Targeted Advertising                   Another major application of Data Science is targeted advertising, which is widely used in digital marketing. You                  might have noticed that the ads you see online often feel very personal, like they’re exactly what you were looking                  for. This is because digital ads are powered by Data Science algorithms that help companies show you ads that are                  most relevant to you.                   Targeted advertising is not just limited to online ads. It can also apply to digital billboards at places like airports,                  where the ads shown might be influenced by the time of day or the type of people passing by, based on their past                  behaviour and real-time location tracking.                                                                                        Statisical Data (Practical)  253","Due to Data Science, targeted ads are far more effective than traditional ones. Traditional advertisements, such               as TV or print ads, are presented to a broad audience, regardless of their interest. In contrast, targeted ads allow               companies to focus on individuals more likely to be interested in their products, resulting in a significantly higher               Click-Through Rate (CTR)—meaning more people click on the ad. This makes digital advertising a more efficient               way for businesses to connect with their customers while ensuring customers see products that align with their               interests.                                               Website Recommendations                We’ve  all  seen  product  suggestions  pop  up  when  shopping  online,  especially  on  websites  like  Amazon.  For               example, when you buy a pair of shoes, Amazon might show you recommendations for complementary products               like shoes, clothing, or accessories. These recommendations help you find products that match your interests,               out of millions of available items. This feature is made possible by machine learning algorithms and collaborative               filtering techniques in data science.               Many other companies and platforms use similar AI-driven recommendation systems to enhance user experience.               Netflix employs deep learning models to suggest TV shows or movies based on your viewing history. Spotify               leverages  audio  analysis  and  user  behaviour  data  to  create  personalized  playlists.

We need No-Code AI tools because:                  • When coding, we often come across different types of errors, and it can be frustrating at times.                   • No-Code AI allows non-technical people—like business owners, marketers, and analysts—to create and use AI                 without needing to know how to code.                      256     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","• No-Code AI simplifies the process by providing pre-built templates and automated features, which saves a lot                    of time.                      • No-Code AI platforms are designed with user-friendly interfaces, often using drag-and-drop functionality that                    anyone can use.                      • No-Code AI tools allow users to get instant predictions or insights.                      • With No-Code tools, more people can experiment with AI and create new ideas or solutions.                     • Many small businesses and startups can’t afford to hire AI experts. No-Code AI makes it possible for them to                    implement AI-driven solutions—like predicting customer behaviour or analysing feedback—without the high                    costs or steep learning curves.                      • In No-Code AI since we do not need to code, we won’t have any code errors.                  Who Can Use No-Code AI?                    No-Code  AI  democratizes  artificial  intelligence,  making  it  accessible  to  professionals  across  various                  industries. For,                     • non-technical professionals like doctors, architects, musicians, and teachers can leverage AI without programming                    expertise.                      • business analysts and entrepreneurs that can use AI-powered insights for data-driven decision-making.                     • educators and students that can experiment with AI applications in learning environments.                   As a result, No-Code AI empowers individuals and organisations across diverse industries and skill levels to leverage                  AI for their specific needs.                  Let’s look at a scenario to understand who can use No-Code AI.                   Problem                    Megha  is  a  nutrition  planner  for  a  large  aquarium  that  houses  a  variety  of  marine  species.  Her  role  involves                  managing the costs of purchasing fish, seafood, and algae to ensure the animals receive a balanced and nutritious                  diet. With the rising costs of marine food supplies, it is becoming increasingly challenging for the aquarium to                  maintain its budget while providing high-quality nutrition for its marine life. The aquarium’s finance team needs                  accurate predictions about future price increases so they can approach government bodies or corporate sponsors                  for additional funding. To achieve this, Megha needs a way to predict the future prices of marine food supplies,                  but she has no experience in coding or AI.                  Solution                    Megha  discovers  a  No-Code  AI  platform  that  allows  her  to  create  an  AI  model  to  predict  the  prices  of  fish,                  seafood, and algae without writing a single line of code. She can use popular No-Code tools like Google AutoML                  or Microsoft Power BI to build a price prediction model tailored to her needs. Emma can upload her data, train the                  model, and generate accurate forecasts in just a few steps.                  From this scenario, we can conclude that you don’t need coding expertise to build an AI model. No-Code AI tools                  empower individuals like Megha, regardless of their technical background, to leverage AI for solving real-world                  problems.

Disadvantages of No-Code AI Tools                 No-Code AI tools also have some disadvantages:                  • Lack of Flexibility: While no-code platforms are great for quick development, they often come with limited                 customization options. The drag-and-drop elements available may not give you the full flexibility to create                 complex features or make deep changes to your application. This means you might run into  functional limitations                 if you need something highly specific or customized.                  • Automation Bias: No-code tools often rely on automated systems to make decisions or suggestions, and users                 may become biased toward these automated suggestions. Over-reliance on automation can lead people to                 trust the AI-generated results too much and overlook other valid alternatives or insights that might be better.                 This can lead to poor decision-making if not carefully managed.                  • Security Issues:  No-code  platforms  generally  don’t  prioritize  security,  leaving  limited  options  for  users  to                 control how their data is protected. These platforms may not follow the best security practices, which could                 be a concern, especially for businesses handling sensitive or private information. They are often more suitable                 for projects that do not involve sensitive data, as they may not offer enough control over data protection and                 security measures.                   • Performance Limitations: As no-code tools focus on ease of use, they may not be optimized for high-performance                 applications. Complex tasks or those requiring intensive processing could experience slower execution or face                 scalability challenges.

The  main  idea  behind  Teachable  Machine   Data under investigation               is  to  make  machine  learning  accessible  to  everyone,   (very large, difficult to use)               whether you’re a beginner or not.                         Important Concepts in Statistics                 Before we go for Statistical Analysis, we need to understand few terms of Statistics.               Population                 The complete collection of raw data available for a test or experiment is referred to as the population. It is not               always feasible to analyse patterns and trends across the entire population. Instead, you can select a sample—a               subset of the population selected for analysis. It should be representative of the population to ensure accurate               conclusions.                Statistical Sampling                Statistical sampling is a method used to select a smaller group (sample) from a larger group (population) to               study. Instead of analysing every individual in a dataset, researchers study the sample and generalize findings to               the whole population. Sampling will help you:                  • Save time as you don’t need to study the complete set of data.                  • It saves money and resources.                  • A well-chosen sample can give you results that are close to what you’d get if you studied everyone.                Let’s say you want to know the average age of people who visit a park. You can’t ask everyone who visits the park,               but you can pick a small group of people at random to ask. If you ask the right group of people, their ages will give               you a good estimate of the average age of all visitors.                Descriptive Statistics                Descriptive  Statistics  summarise  and  describe  a  set  of  data.  Instead  of  examining  every  individual  number,               descriptive statistics helps us see patterns, trends, and key points about the data, making it easier to understand.               It helps answer questions like “What is typical?” or “What is the most common?” We measure Descriptive Statistics               using:                  • Mean (Average): The mean is the most common way to describe the “central” or “typical” value in a set of data.                 It is also known as the average. To find the mean, you add up all the numbers in your data and then divide by                 how many numbers there are.                      260     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","Example: If you have the numbers 6, 3, 4, and 7, the mean is calculated as follows:                                               Mean=6+3+4+7=20/4=5                      So, the mean is 5.                     • Median: The median is the middle value of a dataset when the numbers are arranged in ascending order.                    If there’s an odd number of values, the median is the one right in the middle. If there’s an even number of values,                    the median is the average of the two middle numbers.                     Example 1 (odd number of data points): For the data 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 the median is 5 because it’s in the middle.                       Example 2 (even number of data points): For the data 1, 3, 5, 7, the median is the average of the two middle                     numbers, so it is: Median = (3+5)/2=4                     • Mode: The mode is the number that appears most often in your data set. If a number appears more times than                    any other number, it is the mode.                        Example: For the data set 2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 6, 6, the mode is 6, because it appears three times, more than any other                     number.                     • Distribution: The distribution of a dataset describes the shape of how data values are spread. The shape can                    be left-skewed, right-skewed, or normal, and each type of skewness or symmetry tells us something different                    about how the data is spread out.                                                                     Mode                                                                   Median                                          Mode                      Mean                      Mode                                  Median                                                              Median                                Mean                                                                          Mean                                   Left skewed                Normal Distribution                 Right skewed                      • Left Skewed: A left-skewed distribution has a long tail on the left side (toward the lower values) and the                    majority of the data is on the right. The mean is usually less than the median, and the median is less than the                    mode.                        Example: In a group of people’s income, most people might earn a moderate income, but there are a few                     people earning extremely low incomes, which pulls the average income lower.                      • Normal Distribution (Bell Curve): A normal distribution is perfectly symmetrical and resembles a bell-shaped                    curve. The highest point is in the middle, and the tails gradually taper off on both sides. The mean, median, and                    mode are all the same and are located at the center.                        Example: Heights of people in a large population often follow a normal distribution. Most people will be of                     average height, with fewer people being very short or very tall.                     • Right skewed: A right-skewed distribution has a long tail on the right side (toward the higher values), and                    most of the data is clustered on the left. The mean is usually greater than the median, and the median is                    greater than the mode.                        Example: In a class’s exam scores, most students might score in the middle range, but a few students could                     score extremely high, which pulls the average score higher.                  Probability                    Probability deals with the likelihood or chance of an event happening. It helps us understand how likely or unlikely                  something is to occur based on known information. In simple terms, probability answers the question: “How likely                                                                                         Statisical Data (Practical)  261","is this event going to happen? An event is the outcome of an experiment. Events can be either independent or               dependent.                                                                                                 Outlier               Variance                                                                                           mean                 Variance is a measure of how much the values in a dataset differ                                                                                  Variance               from  the  mean  (average)  value.  It  helps  you  understand  how               spread out or scattered the data is.               A high variance means the numbers are spread out widely around               the mean, while a low variance means the numbers are closer to               the mean.

It gives               a sense of how “far” the data points are from the mean on average.               Outlier                 An outlier is a data point that is significantly different from the other points in the dataset. It’s an “exceptional”               value that is much higher or lower than most of the other values.                                Reboot                       1.

When you’re working with a dataset like TrainData, you’ll notice that most of the columns contain numbers. These                  columns are called Numeric Features, and they represent the input data that your model will use to learn.                   In a supervised learning model, you have two key parts:                  1.  Features: The input data (like age, weight, or height).                  2.  Labels: The output or target that you want to predict (like predicting whether someone will like a product or                  classifying animals into species).                  In the Palmer Penguin dataset, you want to predict the species of the penguins based on other features like size,                  weight, or bill length. Since species is the output (what you’re trying to predict), it should be set as the label.                  To do this, we need to tell the model that species is a label, not just a regular feature.

Standard deviation is the square root of the variance, and it provides a measure of how spread out the values are in                        the original units (not squared units, like variance). It gives a sense of how “far” the data points are from the mean on                        average.                     6.  What is statistical sampling?                     Ans.  Statistical sampling is a method used to select a smaller group (sample) from a larger group (population) to study.                        Instead of analysing every individual in a dataset, researchers study the sample and generalize findings to the whole                        population.                      7.  What is Teachable Machine?                    Ans.  Teachable Machine is a web-based tool developed by Google in November 2017. It allows anyone to create machine                        learning models easily, without needing any coding knowledge. It is especially designed to help people train models                        for tasks such as image recognition, sound classification, and pose detection, using their own data. The main idea                        behind Teachable Machine is to make machine learning accessible to everyone, whether you’re a beginner or not.                      8.

Why do we need No-Code AI? Give any four reasons.                     Ans.  We need No-Code AI tools because:                        • When coding, we often come across different types of errors, and it can be frustrating at times.                        •  No-Code  AI  allows  non-technical  people—like  business  owners,  marketers,  and  analysts—to  create  and  use                           AI without needing to know how to code.                                                                                         Statisical Data (Practical)  299","•  No-Code AI simplifies the process by providing pre-built templates and automated features, which saves a lot                        of time.                     •  No-Code AI platforms are designed with user-friendly interfaces, often using drag-and-drop tools that anyone can use.                  11.  Differentiate between mean and median.                  Ans.  The two measures to use descriptive statistics are:                     Mean (Average): The mean is the most common way to describe the “central” or “typical” value in a set of data. It is                     what we usually call the average. To find the mean, you add up all the numbers in your data and then divide by how                     many numbers there are.                     Example: If you have the numbers 6, 3, 4, and 7, the mean would be:                     Mean=6+3+4+7=20/4=5                     So, the mean is 5.                     Median: The median is the middle value of a dataset when the numbers are arranged in ascending order. If there’s an                     odd number of values, the median is the one right in the middle. If there’s an even number of values, the median is the                     average of the two middle numbers.                     Example 1 (odd number of data points): For the data 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 the median is 5 because it’s in the middle.                     Example 2 (even number of data points): For the data 1, 3, 5, 7, the median is the average of the two middle numbers,                     so it is: Median = (3+5)/2=4                  12.  Write any three disadvantages of no-code tools.                  Ans.  Some of the disadvantages of no-code tools are as follows:                     •  Lack of Flexibility:  While  no-code  platforms  are  great  for  quick  development,  they  often  come  with  limited                        customization options. The drag-and-drop elements available may not give you the full flexibility to create complex                        features or make deep changes to your application. This means you might run into restrictions if you need something                        highly specific or customized.                     •  Automation Bias: No-code tools often rely on automated systems to make decisions or suggestions, and users                        may become biased toward these automated suggestions. People might trust the automated results too much and                        ignore other valid alternatives or insights that might be better. This can lead to poor decision-making if not carefully                        managed.                     •  Security Issues: No-code platforms generally don’t prioritize security, leaving limited options for users to control                        how their data is protected. These platforms may not follow the best security practices, which could be a concern,                        especially for businesses handling sensitive or private information. They are often more suitable for projects that do                        not involve sensitive data, as they may not offer enough control over data protection and security measures.

In Life                                        21 st  Century   #Critical Thinking                                                                                       #Leadership \& Responsibility                                                                                   Skills                  Statistical analysis powered by AI is not just about numbers and trends; it’s about understanding the patterns of                  human behaviour, health, society, and even our environment. Every time we use an app, purchase something online,                  or even interact on social media, AI is silently observing our choices, learning from them, and predicting what might                  happen next. But here's the big question: How much of our lives do we want AI to control or influence based on                  statistical analysis? Should we rely on these predictions to guide our decisions, or is there a danger in allowing                  algorithms to shape the way we think and act?

Computer Vision (Theory)   307","Now, Computer Vision has improved a lot. With better algorithms and programs, faster computers and more data,               things that seemed impossible in the past are now easy to use every day. It helps machines see and understand               the world, just like humans do.               Recently, the technology has advanced even more and is now centre of innovations. It helps businesses work               faster, do tasks automatically, and create new possibilities. Computer Vision is used in many fields, like healthcare,               shopping and entertainment. It is making the world smarter, safer and more efficient.               Let us learn about some applications of Computer Vision.                Facial Recognition                Facial recognition is a technology that uses Computer Vision to identify and verify people based on their facial               features. It has become an important part of smart cities and smart homes, making life more convenient, secure,               and efficient.               This technology removes the need for keys, cards, or manual attendance checks, making tasks faster and easier. It               can quickly detect and alert you to unfamiliar faces, ensuring safety at home, school, or other places.                                     Facial recognition helps make homes safer and smarter in several ways:                  • Security: Smart home systems can recognise family members or regular visitors, allowing them to enter without                 keys or codes. This ensures that only trusted people can access your home.                  • Visitor records: Smart devices can keep track of visitors by recognising their faces and logging the details. This                 makes it easy to see who visited and when.               Schools are also using facial recognition for various tasks:                  • Attendance:  Instead  of  calling  out  names  or  signing  in,  students’  faces  are  scanned  to  mark  attendance                 automatically. This saves time and reduces mistakes.                  • Access control: Facial recognition ensures that only authorised people can enter certain areas, such as labs or                 staff rooms, keeping them secure.                Face Filters                Face filters in Computer Vision are fun and interactive tools that uses algorithm to detect and track facial features,               such as the eyes, nose, mouth, and overall face shape. This process is called facial landmark detection. These filters               then overlay digital effects or objects on a person's face in real time, such as hats, glasses, or funny faces. They are               commonly used in social media apps like Instagram and Snapchat, video conferencing platforms, and Augmented               Reality (AR) applications.                          308     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","Google's Search by Image                   While most people use Google to search for information by typing text, there’s an interesting feature called Search                  by Image that allows you to search using an image instead of words. This feature relies on Computer Vision, a                  technology that enables computers to interpret and analyse images.                                            When you upload an image to Google Search, the system uses Computer Vision Algorithms to analyse the                  image. It extracts key features such as shapes, colours, textures, and patterns. This process is similar to how the                  human brain identifies objects by recognising visual characteristics.                  Next, Google compares these extracted features to its massive database of images collected from across the                  Internet.  Using  advanced  algorithms,  such  as  image  similarity  search  and  pattern  recognition,  it  identifies                  matching or similar images.                  Once the analysis is complete, Google displays search results that are related to the uploaded image.

Additionally, Computer Vision can assess shelf space                 usage to identify inefficient configurations and recommend improved product placements.                   • Enhanced customer experience: Computer Vision facilitates personalised recommendations and streamlines                 the shopping process, making the overall experience smoother and more enjoyable for customers.                   • Improving  security:  Computer  Vision  can  detect  unusual  behaviour,  providing  real-time  alerts  to  security                 personnel, which helps prevent theft or other suspicious activities.                  • Checkout-free shopping: Stores like Amazon Go use Computer Vision to allow customers to pick up items,                 automatically charging them when they leave, thereby eliminating the traditional checkout process.                                Brainy Fact                       In 2012, Google trained a neural network on 10 million YouTube videos, and the AI taught itself to recognise                     cats—even though it was never explicitly told what a cat was!                   Self-Driving Cars                 Computer Vision plays a key role in making self-driving cars (also known as autonomous vehicles) possible.               These cars use Computer Vision to \"see\" and understand the world around them, just like humans use their eyes               to observe their surroundings.                                        310     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","Computer Vision helps self-driving cars in:                     • Identifying objects: Self-driving cars have cameras and sensors that use Computer Vision to detect objects                    around  them.  This  includes  other  vehicles,  pedestrians  crossings,  traffic  signs,  traffic  lights,  and  even  road                    markings. By recognising these objects, the car can make safe decisions, such as stopping at a red light or                    avoiding obstacles.                     • Navigating routes: Computer Vision helps the car to determine the  optimal route by understanding the road                    layout and identifying key points, such as intersections, lanes, and turns. It works along with other technologies                    like GPS to ensure the car follows the correct route.                     • Monitoring the environment: The car constantly monitors its environment using Computer Vision to track                    the  distance  of  surrounding  vehicles,  ensure  the  road  is  clear,  or  detect  any  changes  that,  happen  in  the                    surroundings. This allows the car to respond to unexpected situations, such as an animal crossing the road or                    sudden changes in weather.                   Medical Imaging                   For  many  years,  computer-supported  medical  imaging  has  been  a  trusted  tool  for  doctors  and  medical                  professionals.  This  technology  is  not  just  about  taking  and  viewing  images,  but  also  about  helping  doctors                  analyse and interpret those images to understand a patient's health better.                                   Computer Vision helps medical imaging in:                     • Creating and analysing images: Medical imaging technologies, like X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs, capture detailed                    images of a patient's body. Computer Vision helps doctors examine these images to look for signs of illness or                    injury, such as broken bones, tumors, or other medical conditions.                     • Converting 2D images to 3D models: One of the most important things Computer Vision can do in medical                    imaging is convert flat 2D images (like a traditional X-ray) into interactive 3D models. These 3D models give                    doctors a more detailed view of the body, allowing them to see things from different angles. This helps doctors                    better understand the situation and make more accurate decisions.                     • Helping doctors to interpret results: Computer Vision not only helps in taking images but also in interpreting                    them. It can point out areas that need further attention, making it easier for doctors to spot problems that might                    be hard to see with the naked eye. This is especially helpful in detecting small changes that might indicate the                    beginning of a disease, such as early stages of cancer.                     • Assisting in Surgery: Computer Vision is used in some surgeries to guide doctors. It can show real-time images                    of the area being operated on, helping the surgeon make more precise cuts and decisions.                   Google Translate App                   The Google Translate app has a very handy feature that helps you read signs or text in a foreign                  language. Instead of manually typing words or phrases to translate, you can simply point your phone’s                  camera at the text, and the app will instantly show you the translation in your preferred language.                                                                                       Computer Vision (Theory)   311","The app uses a technology called Optical Character Recognition (OCR), which allows it to \"see\" the text in the               image. OCR scans the letters and words in the picture, recognising them just like a human would read them. So,               when you point your camera at a sign or document, the app identifies the words automatically. It then applies               Augmented Reality (AR) to seamlessly overlay the translation onto the live image, so you can read the translated               text in real-time. The combination of OCR and AR enables a highly accurate and smooth translation experience,               making it convenient for travellers, students, and anyone in need of instant language translation.

Do you think the quality of the camera used in Computer Vision systems matters?                              Computer Vision Tasks                The applications of Computer Vision rely on a set of tasks designed to extract specific information from input               images. This information can either be used directly for predictions or serve as a foundation for further analysis.               These tasks play a critical role in enabling machines to interpret and understand visual data. By processing and               analysing images, Computer Vision systems can perform a wide range of functions across various domains. The               tasks involved in Computer Vision are:                                                        Computer Vision Tasks                                    For Single Objects                            For Multiple Objects                                           Classification                               Object Detection                                        Classification and                           Instant Segmentation                                          Localisation               Single Objects                 This means giving one image as input to the Computer Vision application. It can be further divided into two               categories i.e, classification  and classification + localisation.                          312     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","Classification                   Classification is the process of determining the class or category of an input                  image. The input image is analysed using a Machine Learning Algorithm, which                  assigns it to one of the predefined categories. These categories are established                  by training the algorithm on a set of labelled sample images. This foundational                  task in Computer Vision has numerous practical applications, such as medical                  diagnostics, object recognition and autonomous vehicles. For example, in the                  given image the object is identified as motorcycle.                  Classification and Localisation                   Localisation means where the object is located in the image. So, this combined                  task of classification and localisation means processing the input image to                  identify  its  category  along  with  the  location  of  the  object  in  the  image.  For                  example,  in  the  given  image  the  object  is  identified  as  motorcycle  which  is                  classification and locating the motorcycle in the image is localisation.                  Multiple Objects                   This means giving multiple images as input to the Computer Vision application. It can be further divided into two                  categories i.e. object detection and instance segmentation.                   Object Detection                   Object detection is the process of identifying or detecting the instances of real-                  world objects like cars, bicycles, buses, animals, humans, or anything on which                  the detection model has been trained. This kind of system uses object detection                  algorithms to extract the features of the object and after that Machine Learning                  Algorithms will recognise the instances of an object category by matching it with                  the sample images already fed into the system. It is commonly used in applications such as image retrieval and                  automated vehicle parking systems. For example, in the given image motorcycle and car both are detected.                  Instance Segmentation                    Instance segmentation is the process of dividing an image into smaller segments                  to identify individual objects within it, distinguishing them from the background                  or other objects in the image. Each object instance is detected, classified, and                  assigned a unique label. Following this, every pixel in the image is labelled based                  on the corresponding object instance it belongs to. A segmentation algorithm                  takes an image as input and outputs a collection of regions (or segments).                  Another example of Computer Vision analysis can be seen as follows:                                                  Classification                                     Instance                         Classification                                Object Detection                                                  + Localisation                                  Segmentation                                         CAT                    CAT                    DOG, CAT                  DOG, CAT                                       Single object                                  Multiple objects                                                                                      Computer Vision (Theory)   313","Basics of Images                 An image is a visual representation of any object. The term ‘image’ means a picture that has been created or               stored in electronic form. It can be described in terms of vector graphics or raster graphics. An image comprises               of a rectangular array of dots known as pixel. The size of the image is specified as width × height, in the number               of pixels.

Basics of Pixels                Pixel stands for \"Picture Element\". It is the smallest unit of information in a digital image. These pixels are arranged               in a 2-dimensional grid to form a complete image, video, text, or any visible thing on a digital platform. A pixel can               have only one colour at a time. Colour of a pixel is determined by the number of bits it represents. The more pixels               you have, the more closely the image resembles the original.               In the image below, a specific section has been zoomed in multiple times to reveal its structure in individual               pixel. Each pixel represents a small part of the image, and together, they combine to form the entire picture. As               you examine the zoomed-in portion, you can observe how the arrangement of pixels approximates the original               image. The higher the number of pixels in the image, the more detailed and closer it will appear to the actual               representation.                                                  314     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","Resolution                   Resolution refers to the dimensions that determine the number of pixels present on a screen or in an image. It is                  often measured by multiplying the width with height of the image in pixels, such as 1920×1080 (HD resolution),                  which means the image has 1920 pixels across the width and 1080 pixels along the height.                  In the context of displays or digital images, higher resolution means more pixels are used to represent the image,                  leading to sharper and clearer details.                  Resolution can also be expressed as a single number, such as in megapixels (for cameras), where one megapixel                  equals one million pixels. For example, a 50-megapixel camera captures images with 50 million pixels, which                  affects the level of detail that can be captured in the photograph.                  In the case of our 1920×1024 monitors, it could also be expressed as 1920 × 1024 = 1,966,080 pixels.                  In megapixels:                   1,966,080                            = 1.97 MP.                  1,000,000                   Pixel value                   Each pixel in an image stored on a computer has a specific value that determines its brightness and/or colour.                  The most common pixel format is the byte image, where the pixel value is stored as an 8-bit integer, allowing                  for a range of values from 0 to 255. In this system, a value of 0 typically represents no colour or black, while 255                  represents full colour or white.                  But why do we use a value of 255?                  In computer systems, data is represented using the binary system, which consists of ones and zeros. Each bit in                  a computer's memory can hold one of these two values. Since each pixel is represented by 1 byte of data, which                  consists of 8 bits, the total number of possible values for a pixel is 2 raised to the power of 8 (2^8), resulting                  in 256 possible values. These values range from 0 to 255, providing a nuanced spectrum of pixel intensities for                  representing colours and brightness levels.

Where, ^ represent the exponent.                  Additionally, the use of 8 bits for each pixel allows for the efficient storage and processing of images in a variety                  of applications, from simple graphics to high-definition photographs. With 256 possible values, this system can                  represent different shades of gray or multiple colour channels in formats such as RGB (Red, Green, Blue), where                  each colour channel is also represented by an 8-bit value. This binary representation ensures that images are both                  stored and displayed with a rich depth of colour and brightness while remaining computationally manageable.                                                                                          Computer Vision (Theory)   315","Grayscale Images                Grayscale images are images made up of different shades of gray, ranging from black to white, but without any               colour or hue. It only contains brightness information, meaning they don’t have any colour data (like red, green, or               blue). Each pixel just represents a certain level of brightness or gray, so you don’t see vibrant colours, but you can               still see details in different light or dark areas of the image. The darkest shade is black, representing the complete               absence of colour with a pixel value of 0. The lightest shade is white, indicating the full presence of colour with a               pixel value of 255.               In Grayscale images, each pixel is made up of 1 byte (which is 8 bits). This byte stores the pixel’s brightness level,               with values from 0 (black) to 255 (white). A pixel’s value determines how dark or light it appears on the image.               The pixels in a grayscale image are arranged in a 2D grid (a flat array of rows and columns). The image's height               (number of rows) and width (number of columns) define the size of the image. For example, a grayscale image               with a height of 100 pixels and a width of 200 pixels would have 20,000 pixels in total.               Grayscale images are simpler to process and take up less memory compared to coloured images. This makes them               useful in situations where colour isn’t necessary, like certain types of scans, medical images, or old black-and-white               photos. The value of pixels is within the range of 0-255 for an image.               The images we see, computer stores them in the form of numbers.                                   RGB Images                All coloured images around us are made up of 3 primary colours of Red, Green and               Blue. All the colours are made by mixing these primary colours in varying intensity.     R         B               Every coloured image when split is stored in the form of 3 different channels, R               Channel, G Channel and B Channel. Each channel has a pixel value varying from               0-255. For example, if we see the turquoise colour RGB band would look like [64,               224, 208]. In a coloured image a single pixel contains red, green and blue values in       G               triplets.

What is the output colour when you put values of R, G, B as 0 respectively?                       3.   How does the colour vary when you put either of the three colours as 0 and then keep on varying the other two?                      4.  How does the output colour change when all the three colours are varied in same proportion?                      5.  What is the RGB value of your favourite colour from the colour palette?                                 How does a Computer See Images?                    Every coloured image that is stored can be split into 3 different channels, i.e., Red (R), Green (G) and Blue (B), with                  different intensities. The computer identifies the value related to each pixel and determines the size and colour of                  the image.                                       Each channel is like a layer or plane of the image, focusing on one colour component (red, green, or blue). Every                  channel contains a grid of pixels, and each pixel has a value between 0 and 255.                  where,                     • 0 means no intensity for that colour.                     • 255 means full intensity for that colour.                   For example:                     • A pixel value of [255, 0, 0] means maximum red intensity with no green or blue, so the colour is bright red.                     • A pixel value of [0, 255, 0] means maximum green intensity with no red or blue, so the colour is bright green.                     • A pixel value of [255, 255, 255] means full intensity for all three channels, resulting in white.                  When the computer combines the values from the red, green, and blue channels for each pixel, it creates the final                  colour of that pixel in the image. The three channels together define the colour image. It is the standard format                  used in most digital screens, cameras, and editing software.                                                                                         Computer Vision (Theory)   317","For example, in the given, if we split the image into               three  different  channels,  namely  Red  (R),  Green                    R               {G)  and  Blue  (B),  the  individual  layers  will  have               the following intensity of colours of the individual               pixels.  These  individual  layers  when  stored  in  the               memory looks like the image on the extreme right                         G               i.e. grayscale image because each pixel has a value               intensity  of  0  to  255  and  as  studied  earlier,  0  is               considered as black or no presence of colour and               255 means white or full presence of colour.

Describe the application of facial recognition in Computer Vision.                 Ans.  Facial recognition helps make homes safer and smarter in several ways:                     •  Security: Smart home systems can recognise family members or regular visitors, allowing them to enter without keys                       or codes. This ensures that only trusted people can access your home.                      322     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","•  Visitor records: Smart devices can keep track of visitors by recognising their faces and logging the details. This                          makes it easy to see who visited and when.                        Schools are also using facial recognition for various tasks:                        •  Attendance: Instead of calling out names or signing in, students’ faces are scanned to mark attendance automatically.                          This saves time and reduces mistakes.                        •  Access control: Facial recognition ensures that only authorised people can enter certain areas, such as labs or staff                          rooms, keeping them secure.                     4.  What role does Computer Vision play in Self-driving Cars?                    Ans.  Computer Vision plays a key role in making self-driving cars (also known as autonomous vehicles) possible. These cars                        use Computer Vision to \"see\" and understand the world around them, just like humans use their eyes to observe their                        surroundings.                        It helps self-driving cars in:                        •  Identifying objects: Self-driving cars have cameras and sensors that use Computer Vision to detect objects around                          them. This includes other vehicles, pedestrians crossings, traffic signs, traffic lights, and even road markings. By                          recognising these objects, the car can make safe decisions, such as stopping at a red light or avoiding obstacles.                        •  Navigating routes: Computer Vision helps the car to determine the optimal route by understanding the road layout                          and identifying key points, such as intersections, lanes, and turns. It works along with other technologies like GPS to                          ensure the car follows the correct route.                         •  Monitoring the environment:  The  car  constantly  monitors  its  environment  using  Computer  Vision  to  track  the                          distance of surrounding vehicles, ensure the road is clear, or detect any changes that, happen in the surroundings. This                          allows the car to respond to unexpected situations, such as an animal crossing the road or sudden changes in weather.                     5.  What do you mean by Grayscale images?                    Ans.  Grayscale images are images made up of different shades of gray, ranging from black to white, but without any colour                        or hue. It only contains brightness information, meaning they don’t have any colour data (like red, green, or blue). Each                        pixel just represents a certain level of brightness or gray, so you don’t see vibrant colours, but you can still see details                        in different light or dark areas of the image. The darkest shade is black, representing the complete absence of colour                        with a pixel value of 0. The lightest shade is white, indicating the full presence of colour with a pixel value of 255.                        In Grayscale images, each pixel is made up of 1 byte (which is 8 bits). This byte stores the pixel’s brightness level, with                        values from 0 (black) to 255 (white). A pixel’s value determines how dark or light it appears on the image. The pixels                        in a grayscale image are arranged in a 2D grid (a flat array of rows and columns). The image's height (number of rows)                        and width (number of columns) define the size of the image. For example, a grayscale image with a height of 100 pixels                        and a width of 200 pixels would have 20,000 pixels in total.                   C.

The drone relies on a manual operator to avoid obstacles.                      d.  The drone uses radar to detect objects and adjust its flight path.                    2.  You are tasked with developing a Computer Vision system for a self-driving car company. The system needs to accurately                     detect and classify various objects on the road to ensure safe navigation. Imagine you're working on improving the                     object detection algorithm for the self-driving car's Computer Vision system. During testing, you notice that the system                     occasionally misclassifies pedestrians as cyclists, especially in low-light conditions.                       How would you approach addressing this issue? What steps would you take to enhance the accuracy of pedestrian                     detection while ensuring the system's overall performance and  reliability on the road?

You decide to                     employ Computer Vision technology to enhance safety measures.”                      [CBSE Handbook]                   Assertion and Reasoning questions.                  Direction: Questions 4-5, consist of two statements – Assertion (A) and Reasoning (R). Answer these questions by selecting                  the appropriate option given below:                  a.  Both A and R are correct and R is the correct explanation of A.                   b.  Both A and R are correct but R is NOT the correct explanation of A.                   c.  A is correct but R is incorrect.                  d.  A is incorrect but R is correct.                    4.  Assertion (A): Object detection is a more complex task than image classification because it involves identifying both                     the presence and location of objects in an image.                      Reasoning (R): Object detection algorithms need to not only classify the objects present in an image but also accurately                     localise them by determining their spatial extent.                                  [CBSE Handbook]                   5.  Assertion (A): Grayscale images consist of shades of gray ranging from black to white, where each pixel is represented                     by a single byte, and the size of the image is determined by its height multiplied by its width.                      Reasoning (R): Grayscale images are represented using a three intensities per pixel, typically ranging from 0 to 255.

CASE STUDY: Classification Model: Coral Bleaching                   The purpose of developing a classification model for early identification of coral bleaching to safeguard marine                  ecosystems.                  What Are Coral Reefs?                  Coral reefs are large underwater structures made up of the skeletons of tiny marine animals called coral polyps.                  These  polyps  belong  to  the  group  of  animals  known  as  cnidarians  and  form  symbiotic  relationships  with                  algae called zooxanthellae. The algae live within the coral tissue and provide the corals with food through                  photosynthesis, giving them their vibrant colours.                  Coral reefs are often referred to as the \"rainforests of the sea\" because they are one of the most biodiverse                  ecosystems  on  Earth,  supporting  a  wide  variety  of  marine  life  such  as  fish,  crustaceans,  mollusks,  and  other                  organisms. They are found in shallow, warm, and clear tropical waters, typically in regions like the Great Barrier                  Reef in Australia, the Caribbean, and the Indian Ocean.                  What Causes Coral Bleaching?                  Coral bleaching occurs when corals experience stress due to changes in their environment, causing them to expel                  the zooxanthellae algae from their tissues. Since the algae provide most of the corals' energy and their vibrant                  colour, the corals turn white (hence the term \"bleaching\") and become more vulnerable to disease and death.

Building a Classification Model                  The stages to build a classification model for Coral Bleaching are as follows:                   Stage 1   Problem Scoping                   Coral bleaching occurs when corals lose their vibrant colours and turn white. However, there is much more to this                  phenomenon. The primary cause of coral bleaching is climate change.                  Coral bleaching is significant because once corals die, reef ecosystems rarely recover. With fewer surviving corals,                  reproduction becomes difficult, leading to the deterioration of entire reef ecosystems, which are vital for both people                  and wildlife. Early detection of coral bleaching can help mitigate global disasters and protect marine ecosystems.                  Do you believe that such projects help raise awareness about global issues and inspire you to think of innovative                  solutions to address them?

Image Feature                    In Computer Vision, an image feature refers to a specific element or piece of information extracted from an image                  that provides meaningful insights about its content. Features can include edges, corners, start points, endpoints,                  textures, shapes, or patterns within the image. These features are unique to each image and may vary depending                  on the image's content, resolution, and context.                                                                                         Computer Vision (Practical)  343","Image features play a crucial role in identifying, analysing, and understanding images. They are used in various               applications, such as object detection, facial recognition, image classification, and tracking. For example, edges               highlight transitions between different regions in an image, while corners represent points where two or more               edges meet.               Additionally, image features can be categorised into low-level features, such as colour, texture, and intensity, and               high-level features, such as shapes and objects. By identifying and analysing these features, Computer Vision               systems become capable of mimicking human vision and performing complex visual tasks with accuracy and               efficiency.

At the top of the captured image, you are presented with six                 small image fragments. Your challenge is to carefully locate where each of these fragments appears within the                 larger image. Once identified, use a pencil to mark their exact positions on the image.

Were you able to find the exact location of all the patches?                  2.  Which one was the most difficult to find?                   3.  Which one was the easiest to find?                  Let’s analyse each patch individually and determine their exact locations in the image.                    • For Patch A and Patch B: Patches A and B represent flat surfaces in the image, covering a significant area. These                    patches lack distinct features and can appear anywhere within a broad region of the image. Identifying their                    precise location is challenging due to the uniformity of their texture.                    • For Patch C and Patch D: Patches C and D are relatively easier to analyse compared to A and B. These patches                    represent the edges of a building, which provides some context for locating them. However, pinpointing their                    exact location remains difficult because the edge pattern is repetitive and looks similar throughout the entire                    length of the edge.                    • For Patch E and Patch F: Patches E and F are the simplest to locate in the image. These patches correspond to the                    corners of the building. Corners are distinct features, and the appearance of these patches changes depending on                    their position. This uniqueness makes it easier to identify the exact location of E and F within the image.                        344     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","After completing the activity, we conclude that,                   In image processing, a wide variety of features can be extracted from an image, such as blobs, edges, and corners.                  These features play a crucial role in enabling various tasks, such as object detection, image segmentation, and                  pattern recognition. The analysis derived from these features depends on the specific application at hand.                  A fundamental question that often arises is: which features are most effective for a given task? As demonstrated                  in the previous activity, corners are particularly valuable features because they are unique and can be identified at                  specific locations in an image. In contrast, edges, while also useful, are spread across a line and tend to look the                  same along their length, making them less distinctive for precise localisation.                  This information highlights that corners are excellent features to extract from                  an  image,  as  they  provide  precise  and  reliable  information.  Edges,  while                  slightly less distinctive, are still beneficial and can be used to complement                  corner-based  analysis.  Additionally,  combining  these  features  with  other                  attributes, such as texture and intensity variations, can further enhance the                  accuracy and effectiveness of image processing tasks.                   Let  us  understand  the  concept  of  image  feature  with  the  help  of  another                  activity.                  Observe the images provided and apply the idea of identifying good features in an image.                  In the image above, how can we accurately determine the exact location of every patch? Here’s how different                  patches behave:                      • Blue Patch: This is a flat area, making it challenging to locate and track. No matter where you move the blue                    patch within the image, it appears the same, offering no distinct features for identification.                     • Black Patch: This represents an edge in the image. If you move the black patch along the edge (parallel to it),                    the appearance remains unchanged, making it difficult to determine its precise position.                     • Red Patch: This corresponds to a corner in the image. Unlike the other patches, wherever you move the red                    patch, it looks different, making it unique and easily identifiable.                   Corners, like the red patch, are considered good features in an image because they are distinct and can be                  accurately tracked or located.                                  Reboot                           1.  In image processing, which type of feature is most commonly used for tracking objects in an image?                            2.   What could be the benefit of combining features like texture and intensity with edges and corners in                           image processing?                                                                                                 Computer Vision (Practical)  345","Convolution                 Till now, we have learned an image is a visual representation,               typically made up of tiny elements called pixels. When many               pixels are arranged together in a grid, they form a complete               image that we can see and recognise. Each pixel has a value               ranging from 0 to 255 to specify  color and brightness.        Normal           1977            Aden                The computer stores and image in number. But what happens               if we modify these numbers? The answer is simple: the image               changes. Altering pixel values directly impacts how the image               looks, and this concept forms the foundation of image editing.               Today,  we  commonly  use  various  image  editing  tools  like                                                                              Brannan        Brooklyn        Calrendon               Photoshop, along with apps such as Instagram and Snapchat,               to enhance images by applying filters. These filters work by               uniformly modifying the pixel values across the entire image,               resulting in visual transformations.               But  how  do  these  filters  achieve  such  effects?  This  is               accomplished  using  a  mathematical  process  called          Earlybird      Gingham          Hudson               convolution, which involves a convolution operator to manipulate pixel values and create the desired changes.               Convolution is not only essential for applying filters but also plays a significant role in image processing tasks               like  sharpening,  blurring,  and  edge  detection.  By  altering  pixel  values  systematically  through  convolution,  we               can enhance image quality, add creative effects, or even extract critical features for advanced applications like               Computer Vision.               In simple terms, convolution is passing a \"kernel\" matrix over the whole \"image\" matrix to give the convoluted               matrix i.e., the filtered image.               Technically, convolution is defined as a simple Mathematical operation that multiplies two numeric arrays of the               same dimensions but different sizes to produce a third numeric array of the same dimensions.

If we want the output image to be of exact size of the input image then during the                  process of overlapping the centers of the input image and the kernel, extend the edge values out by one in the                  input image. The pixel value is 0 when edges are extended.                  For example, if 3X3 kernel is used to calculate each pixel, the Kernel filter is multiplied with the current overlapping                  pixel value and the other 8 surrounding pixels. Then the result of the multiplication is added up to generate the                  value of the current pixel.                                                                                      34                              12  11  81  57  86  87  45  68                              23  22  90  56  35  54  12  22                              45  37  91  54  85  25  23  79      1   0   –1                               40  78  69  58  34  74  90  97  ×   0   1   0    =                              12  89  68  90  78  24  68  42      –1  0   1                              34  92  61  43  66  96  23  24                              18  56  41  24  56  45  44  66                              19  67  61  77  23  99  77  23                                     Image Matrix                  Kernel Matrix       Convoluted Matrix/Desired image                                         A                            B                           C                                 Task                                                       21 st  Century   #Critical Thinking                                                                                               Skills                      Use the given input image matrix and kernel matrix of 3×3 to generate the desired image output matrix:                                              150  0  255 240 190  25  89  255                                              100  79  25  0  200 255  67  100                                              155 145  13  20  0  12  45  0         –1  0  –1                                              100 175  0  25  25  15  0   0    ×    0   –1  0                                               120 156 255  0  78  56  23  0         –1  0  –1                                              115 113  25  90  0  80  56  155                                              135 190 115 116 178  0  145 165                                              123 255 255  0  255 255 255  0                     Fill in the blanks in the output matrix by using the above two-image and kernel matrix.

The output image will likely become brighter. Since all values are positive, it enhances the features in the image                  by increasing their intensity. No edges or details are emphasised.                      • Change all values in the convolution matrix to negative numbers.                                 What did you observe?                   The result will be the opposite of the positive values. The image may darken or show an inverse effect.

Neural Networks are a series of algorithms used to recognise hidden patterns in raw data, process it, cluster               and classify it, and continuously learn and improve. They are used in a variety of applications such as predicting               stock prices, identifying sales and marketing trends, risk assessment, and fraud detection. The main advantage of               neural network is that the data features can be extracted automatically by the machine without the input from the               developer. Neural networks are primarily used for solving problems with large datasets, like images.               A Neural Network is divided into multiple layers and each layer is further divided into several units or neurons,               also known as nodes Each neuron processes its inputs, applies a mathematical function and passes the result to               the next layer.                      350     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","First, we have the input layer which receives the input in several different formats provided by the programmer and                  feeds it to the neural network. Minimal processing occurs in the input layer, as it simply passes the raw input data                  forward. The output layer produces the final prediction or decision based on the learned patterns. The output at                  each node is called its activation or node value.                           What is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)?                    Convolutional Neural Network is a type of Artificial Neural Network and is made up of neurons that help in image                  recognition and image processing. It uses a deep learning algorithm that takes an input image, processes it by                  assigning learnable weights and biases to various aspects/objects in the image, enabling the network to identify                  patterns and features helping the system differentiate one image from the other with maximum accuracy. CNNs                  reduce the spatial dimensions (size) of the input through operations like pooling, while retaining the essential                  features and give the predicted class probabilities for the input image. They are trained to identify and extract the                  best features from the images.

Its main objective is to extract key features from the input image, starting               with low-level features like edges, textures, colours, and gradients. These features serve as the building blocks for               the network to understand the content of the image.               In a CNN, this layer is not limited to just one convolutional operation. As the network deepens, additional               convolutional  layers  are  added,  each  progressively  capturing  more  complex  patterns  or  high-level  features               such  as  shapes,  objects,  and  contextual  patterns.  This  enables  the  CNN  to  evolve,  recognising  increasingly               sophisticated and abstract features, ultimately allowing the network to understand entire images.                The convolution operation applies multiple kernels to an image to extract various features from the image. The               result of this process is called a feature map (or activation map), which highlights the important features detected               by the kernels.                The feature map has several key functions:                  • Image Size Reduction: It reduces the image size, often through pooling layers that follow convolutional layers,                  making it easier and faster to process while retaining crucial information.                  • Focus on Relevant Features: It helps focus on the most important features needed for further image processing.                  For example, in plant disease detection, the model may only need to focus on the patterns on the leaves (such                  as discolouration or spots) rather than analysing the entire plant. By emphasising the specific features of the                  leaves, the model can efficiently and accurately detect diseases like fungal infections or bacterial blight, even in                  a crowded field of plants.

ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is an activation function that introduces non-linearity into the model. Its primary               job is to remove negative values from the feature map by setting them to zero while leaving positive values               unchanged.                       352     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","• If the value in the feature map is positive, it stays the same.                     • If the value is negative, it is set to zero.                   This operation allows the network to focus more on the significant features of the input image  which is particularly                  useful in tasks like image recognition.                  Mathematically, ReLU can be represented as:                  ReLU(x) = max(0, x)                  This means that if x is greater than 0, it remains unchanged. But if x is less than or equal to 0, it becomes 0.

The result is a graph that starts at zero for negative inputs and then follows a straight line when                  the values become positive.                  Essentially, the graph \"flattens\" at the negative side (where the output is zero) and then increases linearly on the                  positive side. This introduces non-linearity into the network. This non-linearity helps the network to better model                  complex patterns by allowing it to activate only the important features and ignore less relevant information                  (like negative values).

As a result, positive values are kept, and the transitions between dark and light areas become more defined,                  enhancing the edges and features in the feature map.                                                                                         Computer Vision (Practical)  353","Pooling Layer                This layer reduces the dimensions of the input image while still retaining the important features. This will help               in making the input image more resistant to small transformations, distortions and translations. All this is done               to reduce the number of parameters and computation in the network thus making it more manageable and               improving the efficiency of the whole system.                For example, if an image of an animal is given as an input to the CNN then by just retaining the shape of the eyes,               ears and face it is easy to identify an animal. Keeping all the features could increase the processing time and cause               the model to become more complex and prone to overfitting.                There are two types of pooling:                  • Max Pooling: Max Pooling is the most commonly used method that selects the maximum value of the current                  image view and helps preserve the maximum detected features.                  • Average Pooling: Average Pooling finds out the average value of the current image view and thus downsamples                  the feature map.                                                                                max pooling                                                                                 25   45                                                                                 105   86                                              13  25    45   4                                               11  19    17   26                                               36  110   86   10                                                                              average pooling                                              79  115   19   21                                                                                 17   23                                                                                  85   34                                                                                  Max                                                                   Pooling                                                                                Sum                                Only non-negative values                                      Rectified Feature Map                The pooling layer is important in the CNN as it performs a series of tasks which are as follows:                  • Pooling reduces the spatial dimensions (height and width) of the feature map, which helps reduce the number                  of parameters and computation in the network. This makes the model faster and more efficient.                  • Even though the size is reduced, the most important features (like edges and patterns) are preserved, ensuring                  that the network can still make accurate predictions based on the crucial information.                  • Pooling helps make the model more robust to variations in the input image (e.g., slight changes in position,                  rotation,  or  scale  of  objects  in  the  image).  Since  pooling  looks  at  local  regions,  it  makes  the  network  less                  sensitive to small transformations.                         354     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","• By reducing the spatial dimensions, pooling helps lower the risk of overfitting by simplifying the model,                    ensuring it generalises well to new, unseen data.                                                                                              Max                                                                            Pooling                                                                                            Sum                       A small difference in the input image will create a very similar pooled image.                   Fully Connected Layer                    This is the last and the final layer of the Convolutional Neural Network. After the features of the input image                  are extracted by the convolution layers and downsampled by the pooling layers, their output is a 3-dimensional                  matrix which is flattened into a vector of values. These values of the single vector represent a specific feature of a                  specific label and are redirected to fully connected layers to predict the final outputs of the network. This helps in                  classifying an image into a specific label based on the probability of the input being in a specific class.

Data  Preparation:  Collect  a  dataset  suitable  for  your  specific  task,  such  as  image  classification  or  object                  detection. Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.               2. Model Selection: Choose a CNN architecture suitable for your task, such as VGG, ResNet, or Inception. You may                  also consider using pre-trained models to save time and resources.               3. Model Training: Train the CNN on the training dataset using an appropriate loss function and optimisation                  algorithm. Monitor the model's performance on the validation set during training to avoid overfitting.               4. Evaluation: After training, evaluate the CNN's performance on the test dataset to assess its generalisation                  ability. The common evaluation metrics for image classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall and F1-                  score.                     356     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","5.

Explain the function of the Pooling Layer in a CNN.                 Ans.  The Pooling Layer reduces the dimensions of the input image while still retaining the important features. This will help                     in making the input image more resistant to small transformations, distortions and translations. All this is done to                     reduce the number of parameters and computation in the network thus making it more manageable and improving                     the efficiency of the whole system.                   12.  Why is non-linearity important in a CNN, and how does ReLU introduce it?                 Ans.  Non-linearity is important in a CNN because it allows the network to model complex relationships and patterns within                     the data, which would be impossible with a purely linear system. The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) introduces non-                     linearity by transforming all negative values in the feature map to zero, while leaving positive values unchanged. This                     non-linearity helps the network to better model complex patterns by allowing it to activate only the important features                     and ignore less relevant information (like negative values).                   13.  How are edges and corners different in image analysis?                 Ans.  Edges represent transitions between regions in an image, while corners represent points where multiple edges meet.                     Corners are more distinctive and accurate for precise localisation, while edges are less distinctive.                   14.  Why are No-Code AI platforms gaining popularity?                  Ans.

It allows them to do                  tasks that usually need human thinking. AI works in many areas, like image recognition, robotic control, and                  decision-making. One important domain of AI is Natural Language Processing (NLP), which helps machines                  understand and use human language.                  AI uses advanced techniques like machine learning and deep learning to find patterns, make decisions, and solve                  problems. In NLP, AI enables machines the ability to handle complex language, including semantics (meanings),                  context, and structure.                           What is Natural Language?                    Natural language refers to the language humans use to communicate with one another, such as English, Spanish,                  French, Japanese, Mandarin, and many others. These languages develop naturally over time and are used for                  everyday communication, unlike artificial languages such as programming languages or mathematical notations.                  Rules that Govern Different Languages                    Languages are governed by structured rules, including grammar, syntax, and phonetics, that define their unique                  patterns and usage. These rules ensure clear communication and maintain consistency across speaking, writing,                  and comprehension. Some of the rules governing different languages are as follows:                     • Syntax: This refers to the rules that govern the structure of sentences in a language. It dictates how words and                    phrases should be arranged to make sense. For example, in English, a typical sentence follows the structure:                    Subject + Verb + Object (e.g., “John (subject) eats (verb) an apple (object)”). If the syntax is incorrect, the                    sentence can become confusing or meaningless.                     • Lexicon refers to the complete set of words and their meanings in a particular language. It’s like a “dictionary”                    that contains all the vocabulary used by people to communicate. For example, words like “book,” “eat,” “fast,”                    “run” are part of the English lexicon. These are basic words that people use every day to communicate.                                                                               Natural Language Processing (Theory)  365","• Semantics is about the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences. It looks at how we understand and interpret                 these meanings when we use language. For example, the word “bat” can have different meanings depending                 on the context of a sentence. A bat can refer to a flying mammal (the animal). A bat can also refer to a piece                 of equipment used in sports like baseball or cricket.                                Reboot                        1.  Differentiate between syntax and semantics.                        2.  Name the language used by computers to work.                     Multiple Meanings of the Words                English is one of the natural languages used to communicate. It has words which can have multiple meanings and               different meaning fits into the statement according to its context.               For example,                  • His future is very bright.                   • Today, the Sun is very bright.               In the above sentences the word \"bright\" is playing a different role. This kind of situation can be easily handled by               humans using their intelligence and language skills. However, teaching a computer to understand and interact in               human language is a very challenging task. Now, let us study how Natural Language Processing makes it possible               for the machines to understand and speak in the Natural Languages just like humans.                Features of Natural Languages                 Natural languages have the following key features:                  • They are governed by set rules that include syntax, lexicon, and semantics.                  • All natural languages are redundant, i.e., the information can be conveyed in multiple ways.                  • All natural languages change over time.

While                  human languages evolve naturally for interaction and expression, computer languages are systematically designed                  with logic and precision for programming and computation.                   Human Language                   Human language is the medium used by humans to communicate and interact with others. It consists of syntax                  and semantics, collectively referred to as grammar, which governs the arrangement of words to form meaningful                  sentences. Humans communicate in various languages such as English, Hindi, Spanish and German. For example,                  English uses nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives and other parts of speech to form sentences for spoken or written                  conversations. When such conversations are enriched with past experiences and knowledge, they form intellectual                  exchanges between individuals. Over time, human languages evolve, adding new words to dictionaries based on                  their usage in specific contexts.                  Communication via sound involves the transfer of vibrations through the eardrum to the brain, where they are                  processed as nerve impulses. These impulses are interpreted by the brain, enabling humans to respond appropriately                  to situations.                  Computer Language                    Computer  language,  on  the  other  hand,  is  used  by  programmers  to  create  software  that  enables  humans  to                  interact with electronic devices such as computers. The central processing unit (CPU), known as the “brain” of the                  computer, interprets the instructions provided. The computer’s response manifest as output or the execution of                  commands.                  Computers primarily communicate using binary language, consisting of 0s and 1s. However, this binary language is                  difficult for humans to use directly. To address this, high-level programming languages closer to human language                  have been developed, such as Java, C++, Python, etc. These languages make it easier for humans to interact with                  and program computers. Every computer language has its own syntax and semantics which needs to be followed                  strictly otherwise the computer gives an error and further processing of the task will not be done.                            What is NLP?                    Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on enabling computers,                  through specialised programs, to perform tasks such as speech recognition, translation, and the analysis and                  extraction of large amounts of natural language data. The goal is to facilitate successful interactions between                  humans and machines, delivering the desired output.                   Why is NLP important?                    Communication through text or speech is a common method of interaction among humans. Now, computers are                  equipped with a technology called Natural Language Processing, enabling them to understand, learn, process, and                  manipulate human language.                   Applications of Natural Language Processing                   Natural Language Processing (NLP) is at the forefront of bridging the gap between human communication and                  machine intelligence. By enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language, NLP has                  become a transformative force in modern technology. Its applications are far-reaching, impacting nearly every                  industry and aspect of daily life.                                                                             Natural Language Processing (Theory)  367","Some real-life applications of NLP are as follows:                  • Automatic Text Summarisation: Automatic Text Summarisation is the process of creating the most meaningful                 and relevant summary of voluminous texts from multiple sources. Google News, Blogspot, Inshorts app and                 many other apps are dealing with text summarisation tasks by using Machine learning algorithms that helps in                 producing short and relevant data from the multiple sources, by identifying the important sections in a huge                 textual dataset.                 There are two different approaches of creating Automatic text summarisation:                 o  Extractive summarisation: In this approach, selected text, phrases, sentences or sections are extracted from                    the multiple sources and joined appropriately to form a concise summary.                 o  Abstractive Summarisation: In this approach, the summary is created by interpreting the text from multiple                    sources using advanced NLP techniques. This new summary may or may not have text, phrases or sentences                    from the original documents.

They                 are widely used in areas such as social media and content creation. The captions are generated using speech-                 to-text and image-to-text features on a real time basis. For example, Captions are automatically generated for                 speech, in the language of the meeting, using Instagram’s or YouTube’s captioning tools.                                            • Language Translation: It refers to the process of converting text or speech from one language to another using                 NLP. This technology aids in learning new languages and facilitates cross-cultural understanding. The process of                 language translation continues to evolve, with advancements in AI and NLP making it increasingly fast, accurate,                 and accessible. For example, Google Translate uses deep learning models to improve translation quality over                 time.                        368     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","• Sentiment and Emotion  Analysis:  This application of NLP is highly significant as it helps businesses  gain                    insights into consumer opinions, perform competitive comparisons, and make necessary adjustments to their                    business strategies. The primary goal of sentiment analysis is to identify and interpret emotions and sentiments                    expressed across multiple social media posts, even in cases where emotions are not explicitly conveyed.

Lexical            Syntactic           Semantic            Discourse           Pragmatic                           Analysis            Analysis            Analysis          Integration           Analysis                     These stages of NLP can be explained as follows:                     • Lexical Analysis: In this stage, an AI machine identifies and analyses the structure of words in a speech and                    converts them into text. This text is then converted into paragraphs, sentences and words by lexical analyser.                    Lexicon refers for a collection of the various words and phrases used in a language.                                                 The agile deer leaped over the sluggish bear                                                The agile deer leaped over the sluggish      bear                                                               Lexical Analysis                       In the above example the lengthy text is broken down into individual words.                     • Syntactic Analysis: In this stage, the converted words and sentences are arranged according to the grammar                    of the language. This arrangement highlights the relationships between words. For example, if you are using the                    English language, the syntactic analyser will reject unorganised sentences like “deer over leaped the sluggish bear”.                                                   The agile deer over leaped the sluggish bear                                                                  WRONG                                                   The agile deer leaped over the sluggish bear                                                                   RIGHT                       In the above example, the grammar is checked.                                                                            Natural Language Processing (Theory)  373","• Semantic Analysis: In this stage, the semantic analyser checks the meaningfulness of the text and extracts                  logical meaning from it. This task is done by mapping syntactic structures and objects in the task domain. In the                  example the meaning of the sentence is checked to make sure it actually makes sense. For example, it will reject                  a sentence that contains “cruel kindness” in it.                                                  The agile deer over leaped the sluggish bear                                                               WRONG                                                 The agile deer leaped over the sluggish bear                                                                 RIGHT                     • Discourse Integration: In this stage, the meaning of the sentence is drawn according to the meanings of the                  preceding and succeeding sentences.                                          The agile deer leaped over the sluggish bear. Then it went                                                            into the hedges.                                                        Here \"it\" means \"the deer\"                                           The agile deer leaped over it. Then it went into the hedges.                                                           Here \"it\" is unknown                     In the example, the meaningfulness of the preceding statement is dependent on the meaningfulness of the                 previous statement.                  • Pragmatic Analysis: In this stage, deriving those aspects of language which require real world knowledge. The                  actual meaning of the sentence is rechecked in this process.                                                      Hang on, I will see you in a while.

A chatbot is an                  AI-powered application that automates tasks like saying good morning when you wake up, telling you news on                  a daily basis, helping you choose a route with less traffic for your school, ordering a coffee for you on your way                  back home.                  Chatbot is a short form of “Chat Robot”, also known as conversational agent. It is an AI enabled computer                   program that communicates with the user in natural human language either through voice or text. Chatbots                  are commonly integrated into mobile apps, websites, messaging platforms, and virtual assistants.                  Unlike traditional applications, chatbots do not require installation on your computer or phone. They function as                  cloud-based services, eliminating the need for downloads, updates, or local storage.                   When you do live chats on websites you are probably dealing with chatbots. Most of the companies across the                  globe are using Chatbots to have a wide range of customers and to cater to their customised needs. For example,                  you  visit  an  online  showroom  of  party  apparels.  You  are  confused  about  what  to  buy—a  short  dress,  simple                  formals, glittery gown etc. This difficult situation can be easily handled through chatbots. It will help you to make                  your choice in a smoother way depending on your likes and preferences.                   Some of the virtual assistants like Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Siri, etc. are considered as smarter versions of                  chatbots as they handle the conversations as well as other tasks in a smart and intelligent way just like a human                  with a brain.                   Have you ever wondered why chatbots are created? They are meant to make it feel as if we are talking to a real                  human as this is the way we are comfortable with. There are several chatbots here, which are further divided into                  groups. Spend some time interacting with the chatbot, and then we will review our experience. Let us look at some                  more chatbots to have a clear picture on how Natural Language Processing can turn out to be a miracle in the                  world of Artificial Intelligence.

While, some are made               intelligent as they can handle patterns and common human behaviours while others are smart AI machines which               can work, think and learn from their experience like a human.               Chatbots are generally categorised into two types: Script-bot and Smart-bot.               Script-bot               A Script-Bot is a simple chatbot with limited functionalities. These chatbots follow predefined rules and execute               specific tasks based on a scripted flow. Since they operate within a structured framework, they are easy to develop               and require little to no programming knowledge.                        376     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","These chatbots are best suited for straightforward tasks such as, automating home functions (e.g., turning off                  lights with a voice command) and ordering food online through basic menu selections. Some of the companies                  use them as customer care services for providing interactive frequently asked questions services to the customers                  and if these chatbots are unable to handle certain queries then they connect a company’s customer care employee                  directly to the customer.

Text Processing                Making a computer understand natural language is a complex process. First, we need to understand that humans               interact using characters, words, and sentences, while machines interact using numbers. So, to make the machine               learn and process a sentence in terms of numbers we first need to follow a Pre-Processing stage of NLP about               which we will study in detail.                Text Normalisation                Text normalisation is the process of cleaning textual data by converting it into a standard form. It is considered as the               pre-processing stage of NLP, as it is the first step before beginning actual data processing. This process helps reduce               the complexity of the language. Words used as slang, short forms, misspellings, abbreviations, or special characters               with specific meanings need to be converted into their canonical form during text normalisation. For example,                                                     Words                  Canonical Form                                              B4, beefor, bifore               before                                              2morrow, 2mrow                 tomorrow                                                     btw                      by the way                                                     ty                      thank you                                                      gm                    good morning                                                   gr8, grt                     great                 A corpus is a large collection of text, such as articles, rhymes, or email. A document is a single piece of text within               the corpus, like a sentence in an article, a line in a rhyme, or a section of an email. The entire set of text from all the               documents together is known as the corpus.                Steps for Text Normalisation                The steps for text normalisation are as follows:                Step 1  Sentence Segmentation               Sentence segmentation is a process of detecting sentence boundaries, which divides the corpus into sentences or               documents.                      378     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","Most of the human languages used across the world have punctuation marks to mark the boundaries of the                  sentences, this feature helps reduce the complexity of the big data set into a low and less complicated level of data                  processing.

AI is a technique of getting machines                         that  are  incorporated  with  human-like             to work and behave like humans.                         intelligence to perform tasks as we do.                                                                             3.  The  machines  that  are  incorporated                                                                               with   human-like   intelligence   to                                                                               perform tasks as we do.                   Step 2  Tokenization                   Tokenization is the process of dividing the sentences further into tokens. A token can be any word or number                  or special character that forms a part of a sentence. This process is done mainly by finding the boundaries of                  a word i.e., where one word ends and the other word begins. In English, a space in between two words is an                  important word boundary detector.                                                                                The     machines    that     are                             The  machines  that  are  incorporated  with                                                                              incorporated  with  human   –    like                            human-like intelligence to perform tasks as                            we do.                                                                               intelligence  to  perform   tasks                                                                                as   we    do     .                    Step 3  Removing Stopwords, Special Characters and Numbers                   Stopwords are frequently occurring words that do not contribute significant meaning to text analysis but are                  necessary for human readability. These words are removed during preprocessing to improve efficiency.                   Some examples of stopwords are:                                   a        an        and         are       as        for        #         @                                           from        is        into        in        if        $                                  on        or        such        the      there      to         %          !                     At this stage all the stopwords or special characters like #$%@! or numbers if not needed are removed from the                  list of tokens to make it easier for the NLP system to focus on the words that are important for data processing.                  Step 4  Converting Text to a Common Case                  This is a very important step as we want the same word but different case to be taken as one token so that the                  program does not become case sensitive. We generally convert the whole content into a lower case to avoid this                  kind of confusion and sensitivity by the system.

This               process helps in normalising the text into its root form but the disadvantage is that it works on all the affixes               irrespective whether a base word is a meaningful word or not. Hence it is a faster process.

For               example, in this case, \"jumped,\" \"jumping,\" and \"jumper\" were all reduced to \"jump,\" whereas \"flies\" was shortened               to \"fli,\" which is not a meaningful word. Stemming does not consider whether the stemmed word makes sense; it               simply removes affixes, making the process faster.                Step 6  Lemmatization                This is a process of removing the affixes from the words to create a meaningful root word. The word we get after               removing the affix is called lemma. Since it always focusses on creating a meaningful lemma, the processing time               is longer and better from stemming.

Bag of Words                 After the process of text normalisation, the corpus is converted into a normalised corpus, which is a collection of               meaningful words with no sequence.               Bag of Words is a simple and important technique used in Natural Language Processing for extracting features               from the textual data. It converts text sentences into numeric vectors by returning the unique words along with its               number of occurrences.

Step 1  Text Normalisation                     • Document 1: [preeti, said, will, go, to, the, market]                     • Document 2: [pooja, join, her]                     • Document 3: [sonia, ajay, not]                   Step 2  Create Dictionary                     • Here you will create a list of unique words                    preeti         said              will              go               to                the                   market         pooja             join              her              sonia             ajay                    not                   Step 3  Create a Document Vector                  In this step, the list of words from the dictionary is written in the top row. Now, for each word in the document 1, if it                  matches with the vocabulary in the dictionary, put a 1 under it. If the same word appears again, increment the previous                  value by 1. And if the word does not occur in that document, put a 0 under it. For example, document 1 vector will be:                    Document       preeti  said   will  go   to   the   market    pooja    join  her    sonia  ajay   not                   Doc-1          2       1      1     1    1    1     1         0        0     0      0      0      0                    Step 4  Repeat the above Steps for all Documents                  In the above normalised corpus, we have three documents. So, three lines will be created after this step to create                  our Document Vector Table as shown below:                    Document      preeti  said   will   go   to   the   market    pooja   join  her    sonia   ajay  not                   Doc-1         2       1      1      1    1    1     1         0       0     0      0       0     0                   Doc-2         0       0      1      0    0    0     0         1       1     1      0       0     0                   Doc-3         0       0      1      1    0    0     0         0       0     0      1       1     1                                                                                                21 st  Century   #Media Literacy                                                                                                  Skills                            Video Session                         Watch this video of Bag of Words (BoW) Intuition at the given link:                         https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyEHxFu4XIo or scan the QR code and answer the                        following question:                        How does Bag of Words work?                        Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF)                   The bag of words algorithm identifies the occurrence of words in each document within a given corpus. It helps                  us understand that if a word occurs frequently in a document, it holds more significance for that document. For                  instance, if we have a document about climate change, words like \"climate\" and \"change\" would appear frequently.                                                                            Natural Language Processing (Theory)  383","These words are valuable because they provide context about the document’s subject.               Now, imagine we have a collection of 10 documents, each discussing a different topic. One might be about renewable               energy, another about artificial intelligence, and so on. Do you think \"climate\" and \"change\" would still be the most               frequent words across the entire corpus? Likely not. Instead, words like and, is, or the would appear most frequently.               These high-frequency words, such as and, is, the, etc., do not provide meaningful information about the corpus’s               content. While these words are essential for humans to comprehend sentences, they are irrelevant for a machine               as they do not contribute to understanding the topics within the corpus. These are known as stop words and are               usually removed during the pre-processing stage.               The graph to represent the text in all documents in corpus will be:                                                          Stop words                                                  Occurrence     Frequent words                                                                                     Rare/Valuable                                                                                  words                                                                    Value               This graph shows the frequency of words against their significance. Words that appear most frequently across all               the documents in a corpus hold minimal value and are classified as stop words. These are typically removed during               the pre-processing stage.               As we move past the stop words, the frequency of occurrence drops sharply, and words that occur moderately in               the corpus are considered to have some value. These are referred to as frequent words and generally relate to the               document’s subject.               Further down the frequency scale, the occurrence of words decreases, but their significance increases. These are               known as rare or valuable words. Though they appear the least, they contribute the most meaning to the corpus.               Therefore, when analysing text, we focus on both frequent and rare words.               TFIDF stands for Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency. This method is considered better than the               Bag of Words algorithm. Because, Bag of Words gives the numeric vector of each word in the document but TFIDF               through its numeric value gives the importance of each word in the document.               TFIDF was introduced as a statistical measure of important words in a document. Each word in a document is given               a numeric weight based on its occurrence within that document and across the entire corpus.               Let’s continue with the above example,               The corpus with 3 documents is given as follows:                  • Document 1: Preeti said, “Preeti will go to the market.”                  • Document 2: Pooja will join her.                  • Document 3: Sonia \& Ajay will not go.                Note, As the corpus is too small we are not removing the stopwords.               After normalising the text and creating the dictionary of words, now create a Term-Frequency table.                       384     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","Term Frequency                   Term Frequency is the frequency of a word in one document. Term frequency can easily be found from the document                  vector table as shown in the above example:                    Document     preeti said    will  go     to    the    market pooja join      her    sonia  ajay   not                   Doc-1        2       1      1     1      1     1      1        0      0      0      0      0      0                   Doc-2        0       0      1     0      0     0      0        1      1      1      0      0      0                   Doc-3        0       0      1     1      0     0      0        0      0      0      1      1      1                  Document Frequency                  Document Frequency is the number of documents in which the word occurs irrespective of how many times it has                  occurred in those documents. It is shown below using the above example:                                 preeti  said   will   go    to    the    market   pooja   join  her    sonia  ajay   not                                1       1      3      2     1     1      1        1       1     1      1      1      1                  Here, you can see that the document frequency of ‘go’ is 2 as it occurred in two documents on the other hand it is                  3 for ‘will’ as it occurs in all three documents and rest of them occurred in just one document hence the document                  frequency for them is 1.                  Inverse Document Frequency                  Inverse Document Frequency is obtained by dividing the document frequency of a specific word by the total                  number of documents. It is shown below using the above example:                                                                   Total Number of Documents                                                            IDF =                                                                     Document Frequency                                  preeti  said   will   go    to    the   market   pooja   join   her   sonia   ajay  not                                   3      3      3     3      3     3       3       3      3      3      3      3     3                                   1      1      3     2      1     1       1       1      1      1      1      1     1                   Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)                  Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is calculated by multiplying Term Frequency of a word with                  the log of Inverse Document Frequency.                  Therefore, the formula of TFIDF for any word W becomes:                                                        TFIDF(W) = TF(W) * log(IDF(W))                   Here, log is to the base of 10.                  Now, let us calculate the TFIDF(W) for the above example:                  Document      preeti  said  will   go    to     the    market  pooja   join   her   sonia   ajay  not                                  2*      1*    1*     1*    1*     1*      1*      0*     0*     0*     0*     0*    0*                  Doc-1          log   3  log   3  log   3  log   3  log   3  log   3  log   3  log   3  log   3  log   3  log   3  log   3  log   3                                    1      1      3      2     1      1      1        1      1      1     1      1      1                                  0*      0*    1*     0*    0*     0*      0*      1*     1*     1*     0*     0*    0*                  Doc-2          log   3  log   3  log   3  log   3  log   3  log   3  log   3  log   3  log   3  log   3  log   3  log   3  log   3                                    1      1      3      2     1      1      1        1      1      1     1      1      1                                  0*      0*    1*     1*    0*     0*      0*      0*     0*     0*     1*     1*    1*                  Doc-3          log   3  log   3  log   3  log   3  log   3  log   3  log   3  log   3  log   3  log   3  log   3  log   3  log   3                                    1      1      3      2     1      1      1        1      1      1     1      1      1                  Note that, the value of log (1) is 0.                                                                               Natural Language Processing (Theory)  385","After calculating all the values, we get:                 Document     preeti  said   will   go    to    the    market   pooja  join   her    sonia  ajay  not                Doc-1        0.9542  0.4771 0     0.1761 0.4771 0.4771 0.4771  0      0      0     0       0     0                Doc-2        0       0      0     0      0     0      0       0.4771  0.4771 0.4771 0      0     0                Doc-3        0       0      0     0.1761 0     0      0       0       0      0     0.4771 0.4771 0.4771               Finally, the words have been converted to numbers. These numbers are the values of each word for each document.               Hence after the end of the above process we get:                  • Stopwords generally have high term frequencies in all documents but tend to have lower TF-IDF values.                  • To achieve a high TF-IDF value, the term frequency (TF) should be high, but the document frequency (DF) should                 be low. That is, some words may be important for one document but are not common across all the other                 documents in the corpus.                  • These numeric values represent the words that need to be considered while processing NLP. A higher TF-IDF                 value indicates that a word is more significant for distinguishing a document within a given corpus.                Applications of TFIDF                Some of the important applications of TFIDF are:                  • Document Classification: It helps in categorising documents based on their content, such as topic, genre, or                 subject matter.                  • Topic Modelling: It helps in predicting the topic of the corpus.                  • Information Retrieval System: It searches the corpus and retrieves the information based on most relevant                 searches.                  • Stop Word Filtering: It helps in removing the stop words from the documents in the corpus so that the data                 retrieval and processing can focus on words which are important for data processing.

Short answer type questions.                    1.  Define Semantics.                 Ans.  Semantics is about the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences. It looks at how we understand and interpret these                     meanings when we use language. For example, the word “bat” can have different meanings depending on the context                     of a sentence. A bat can refer to a flying mammal (the animal). A bat can also refer to a piece of equipment used in                     sports like baseball or cricket.                          388     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","2.  Write the features of natural languages.                    Ans.  Some of the features of natural languages are:                        •  They are governed by set rules that include syntax, lexicon, and semantics.                        •  All natural languages are redundant, i.e., the information can be conveyed in multiple ways.                        •  All natural languages change over time.                     3.  Why is NLP important?                    Ans.  Communication through text or speech is a common method of interaction among humans. Now, computers are                        equipped with a technology called Natural Language Processing, enabling them to understand, learn, process, and                        manipulate human language.                     4.  What do you understand by the term text classification?                    Ans.  Text classification is the process of automatically organising text into predefined categories based on content and                        context. For example, email services like Gmail use NLP-based spam filtering to classify emails into spam and non-spam                        categories. Articles can be organised by topics, chat conversations can be categorised by languages, and customer                        reviews can be grouped by sentiment or relevance.                     5.  How many stages is NLP (Natural Language Processing) typically divided into?                    Ans.  This process is divided into five major stages which are as follows:                        •  Lexical Analysis                        •  Syntactic Analysis                        •  Semantic Analysis                        •  Discourse Integration                        •  Pragmatic Analysis                  B.  Long answer type questions.                      1.  Explain the five stages of NLP.                    Ans.  The five stages of NLP can be explained as follows:                        •  Lexical Analysis: In this stage, an AI machine identifies and analyses the structure of words in a speech and converts                           them into text. This text is then converted into paragraphs, sentences and words by lexical analyser. Lexicon refers                           for a collection of the various words and phrases used in a language.                        •  Syntactic Analysis: In this stage, the converted words and sentences are arranged according to the grammar of the                           language. This arrangement highlights the relationships between words. For example, if you are using the English                           language, the syntactic analyser will reject unorganised sentences like “deer over leaped the bear”.                        •  Semantic Analysis: In this stage, the semantic analyser checks the meaningfulness of the text and extracts logical                           meaning from it. This task is done by mapping syntactic structures and objects in the task domain.                        •  Discourse Integration: In this stage, the meaning of the sentence is drawn according to the meanings of the                           preceding and succeeding sentences.                        •  Pragmatic Analysis: In this stage, deriving those aspects of language which require real world knowledge. The                           actual meaning of the sentence is rechecked in this process.                     2.  Differentiate between smart-bot and script-bot.                    Ans.

You have a dataset with a variety of abbreviations and misspelled words. How would you use text normalisation to                        standardise this dataset for further processing?                    Ans.  To standardise the dataset, text normalisation would involve:                         •  Correcting misspellings (e.g., \"definately\" → \"definitely\").                        •  Expanding abbreviations (e.g., \"btw\" → \"by the way\", \"lol\" → \"laughing out loud\").                        •  Converting to lowercase to ensure consistency.                        •  Expanding contractions (e.g., \"I'm\" → \"I am\"). These actions help reduce variation in the data and improve model                          understanding.                      2.

Solution               To identify the source of the problem and find an optimal solution using NLP, we should follow the given steps:                Step 1    Data Collection: Collect feedback data from multiple sources (e.g., survey results, customer emails,                         social media posts).                Step 2   Preprocessing: Data to be pre-processed by following the given instructions:                         •  Clean the text (remove special characters, stopwords, etc.).                         •  Tokenise the text into words or phrases for analysis.                         •  Normalise data (e.g., lowercase, stemming/lemmatisation).                Step 3    Sentiment Analysis: Use NLP tools like spaCy, NLTK, or no-code platforms like MonkeyLearn to detect                         positive, negative, or neutral sentiment in feedback.                Step 4    Topic Modelling: Apply topic modelling techniques to identify common themes or issues mentioned                         in feedback (e.g., \"delivery delays\" or \"product quality\").               Outcome               The company uncovers that most complaints are about delayed deliveries in a specific region. Based on these               insights, they optimise logistics for that region, reducing complaints by 30%.                         Sentiment Analysis                 Sentiment analysis is a technique within Natural Language Processing (NLP) that helps determine the               emotional tone behind a piece of text. The goal is to analyse whether the text expresses a positive, negative,               or neutral sentiment.               This can  be applied to various forms of communication, such as customer reviews,  social media posts, and               feedback messages, to gain insights into how people feel about a specific topic, product, service, or brand.               1.  Customer Service                    Customer sentiment  analysis  helps  in the automatic detection of emotions  when customers interact with                   products, services, or brands.               2.

Sentiment Analysis Methods                    Sentiment Analysis Methods can be used to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, such as a                  review, comment, or social media post. It helps to identify whether the expressed sentiment is positive, negative,                  or neutral. Some of the Sentiment Analysis methods are as follows:                     • Liu Hu: It uses English and Slovenian languages. It utilises a lexicon-based approach for sentiment analysis. This                    means it relies on predefined dictionaries of positive and negative words to determine sentiment.                      • Vader (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner): It uses English language. It is a lexicon- and                    rule-based method designed to capture both the intensity (valence) and polarity (positive, negative, neutral) of                    sentiments in text.                      • Multilingual Sentiment: It supports multiple languages. It is also lexicon-based, but focuses on accommodating                    several languages for broader applicability.                     • SentiArt: It uses English and German. It is based on vector space models, which are computational methods                    representing words or phrases in multi-dimensional space, it computes the valence (emotional value) of text.                      • Custom Dictionary: It allows users to define dictionaries with their own positive and negative terms. It offers                    flexibility by enabling users to tailor sentiment dictionaries to specific contexts. The analysis follows Liu Hu's                    computation method.                                   Reboot                         1.

The Anaconda software will be installed.                  After installing Anaconda, you can open the Anaconda Prompt by typing 'Anaconda Prompt' in the Windows                  search bar. The Anaconda Prompt is a command-line interface used for Python programming, enabling the                  creation of virtual environments and the management of installed packages.                  Anaconda Navigator serves as an alternative to the Anaconda Prompt. It is a desktop graphical user interface                  included with Anaconda that allows you to configure settings, install packages, and launch tools such as Jupyter                  Notebook. Jupyter Notebook can also be accessed through the Anaconda Prompt via a local host.                            Understanding Jupyter Notebook                    Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web-based application where a single document contains Python code,                  output window, explanations, formulas, charts, etc. It is a very powerful tool popular with data scientists and AI                  experts for data cleaning, statistical modelling, visualization, Machine Learning, Deep Learning etc. needed for                  developing and presenting Artificial Intelligence models and projects.                   The Jupyter Notebook is the next version of IPython Notebook, which was first published as a prototype in 2010.                  It supports many programming languages like Python, R, Julia etc. You can also work in a Jupyter notebook in                  online mode using https://colab.research.google.com/                                                                                      Advance Python (Practical)  415","Installing Jupyter Notebook                The Jupyter Notebook comes pre-installed in the Anaconda package. Therefore, the steps above that we followed               to install Anaconda on our computer has already installed Jupyter Notebook. Use a local host to access Jupyter               Notebook through the Anaconda Prompt. To work with it in a virtual environment we first have to install a               default kernel (IPython) that provides programming language support for Python in Jupyter.                          What is a Virtual Environment?                 A virtual environment is an important tool that helps you create a unique, isolated environment for each project               in Python. This means each environment will have its own set of activities, software settings, and packages,               including different Python versions. This is useful if you need different versions of Python or packages for               different projects. For example, if a Python developer is using version 2.7 for one project and version 3.4 for               another project the virtual environment is very useful in providing separate environments.                Creating a Virtual Environment                 The steps for creating a virtual environment using Anaconda distribution are given below:                Step 1   Type Anaconda Prompt in the Search box beside the Start button.                 Step 2   Click on Anaconda Prompt option.                                                    This will open a window with default (base) written to show that it is the default environment in which                         the anaconda works.                           We can create our own virtual environment to work in our own projects without affecting the base                         virtual environment.                          Let us create our own virtual environment by giving the following command at the prompt sign:                         conda create -n myenvion Python=3.12.7                                  416     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","The above code will create a new environment named myenvion with Python 3.12.7 and some basic                            packages useful for working in it.

Introduction to Python                 Python is a general-purpose, object-oriented, easy-to-learn high-level programming language. Guido van Rossum               designed Python at Centrum Wiskunde \& Informatica and released it in 1991. He wanted to give a unique  name,               so he named it after the famous BBC comedy TV show “Monty Python's Flying Circus”.                       424     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","Python as a language supports simple English-like statements making it easy for programmers to learn and                  maintain the code. It has both procedural and object-oriented programming approaches. These important points                  make it more popular among the programmers.                            Why Python for Artificial Intelligence?                    There are many programming languages like Lisp, Prolog, C++, Java and Python, which can be used for                  developing applications of AI. Python gained its popularity due to the following reasons:                     • It is easy to Read, Write, Learn and Maintain: It has simple English-like statements which are easy to learn                    and use. Anybody can easily get used to its syntax and gain expertise in it.                     • Large Standard Library: Python has a large number of built-in modules and packages for handling various                    types of problems especially related to AI. These important libraries make it popular specially in AI-based                    programs where we need to focus more on its use and rather than its core design.                     • Interactive Mode:  The  interactive  mode  in  Python  provides  flexibility  of  testing  and  debugging  the  code                    snippets before implementing in actual AI model.                     • Portability and Compatibility: Python supports multiple platforms like Windows, Linux, Mac, Raspberry, Pi,                    etc. which means code written on one platform can easily run on another platform with little or no changes.  It                    has the same interface on all platforms.                     • Extendable: It allows the addition of low-level modules to the Python interpreter that helps a programmer to                    customise their tools according to their requirements in an efficient manner.                     • Databases and Scalability: Python provides support to all types of databases along with a better structure                    and support so that it can hold increasing amounts of data without sacrificing performance for much larger                    programs than shell scripting.

Some of them are listed below:                     • It is used for Web and Internet Development: Python has pre-built libraries and web frameworks like                    Pyramid, Django, and Flask, which are used for back-end web development projects. Some standard libraries                    also support content design, database connectivity and many internet protocols like HTTP, SMTP, XML etc.                                                                                      Advance Python (Practical)  425","• Desktop and GUI Applications:  Python provides the Tkinter library,  which can be used to develop user                  interfaces for desktop applications.                  • Database Access: Python provides database access by supporting different varieties of databases like MySQL,                  GadFly, mSQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server 2000 etc.                  • Business Applications: Python provides business Applications for e-commerce, ERP etc. due its highly scalable,                  extensible and easily readable feature.                   • Scientific and Numeric Calculation: SciPy, Pandas, NumPy are some of the built-in packages in Python which                  are used for scientific and numeric calculations.                   • Game Development and 3D Graphics: PySoy (a 3D game engine that supports Python 3) and PyGame are                  two Python-based libraries used widely for game development. Many popular games like Battlefield 2, Frets                  on Fire, World of Tanks, Disney’s Toontown Online etc. are designed using Python game libraries.                   • Software Development: Python is used for general-purpose software development. It also supports audio and                  video files that help in designing multimedia applications.                         Recap of Python Basics                 Python as a programming language was introduced in class 9 in detail. Let us now do a quick recap of some               important concepts and syntax necessary for writing a programs.               Python Character Set                A character set can be a set of valid characters like:                   • Digits from 0 to 9.                  • Alphabets in upper or lowercase from A to Z or a to z.                  • Special symbols like $, %, ^, \&, *, (, ), @, !, _, ~.                  • Whitespaces like spacebar, tab key or enter key.                  • ASCII or UNICODE Characters like emoji symbols or other symbols with unique code.               What is a Statement in Python?                 Instructions written in a source code and are executed by a Python interpreter are called statements. In Python               we can write statements in 3 different ways. Let us learn about them in detail.                Simple Statements                By default, the end of a statement is done by pressing an Enter key. Each statement is written on a new line. For               example, a=5 is a simple statement where variable a is created with value 5.                 [1]:   a = 5                Multiline Statements                In Python, a statement that doesn't fit on one line can be extended over multiple lines. This can be done in               several ways:                   • Using Parentheses (): You can break a long expression or function call across multiple lines if it is enclosed in                  parentheses. Python allows this without any additional special characters.                  [1]:   result = (11 + 15 + 148 +                                 154 + 87)                       426     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","• Using Braces {} (for dictionaries or sets): Similar to parentheses, curly braces can be used to break long                    dictionary or set definitions across lines.                   [1]:   my_dict = {                             'name': 'John',                             'age': 30,                             'city': 'New York'                         }                      • Using Square Brackets [] (for lists): You can also break a list definition or list comprehension into multiple                    lines using square brackets.                  [1]:   my_list = [                             1, 2, 3, 4,                             5, 6, 7, 8                         ]                      • Using the Continuation Character (\\): A backslash (\\) at the end of a line indicates that the statement continues                    on the next line. This method is used for breaking any statement into multiple lines.                   [1]:   result = 11 + 15 + 148 + \\                                  154 + 87                    Multiple Statements                   Multiple statements mean more than one statement in a single line. This can be done by separating the                  statements using semicolons (;).                   [1]:   a=5; b=10; c=a+b; print(c)                         15                    Comments                   Comments are used to increase the readability of the code. We use it to give proper understanding of the code in                  simple English statements. They are completely ignored by the Python interpreter and do not display or affect the                  output of the code. It is always a good practice to add comments in your code so that if anybody in future wish to                  understand or modify your code then through comments it become easy to know what you have written in a code.                  In Python we can give two different kind of comments. Let us discuss about them.                  Single Line Comments                    Starts with a hash symbol ‘#’ followed by the text to be written as a comment that lasts till the end of the line.                   [1]:   # This creates variables for storing marks                         english=93                         maths=92                         # Calculating the programs                         c=(english+maths)/2                   Multiline Comments                    When writing multi-line comments, we begin the comment with three single quotes ''' or three double quotes                  \"\"\", followed by the comment text spread across multiple lines. The comment ends with the same three single                  or double quotes ''' or \"\"\".

They are case sensitive. We can see the list of the reserved keywords by giving the following               command at the Python command prompt:                    import keyword                   keyword.kwlist               Following is the list of keywords displayed by giving the above commands:                      False                class                finally              is                   return                     None                 continue             for                  lambda               try                      True                 def                  from                 nonlocal             while                     and                  del                  global               not                  with                      as                   elif                 if                   or                   yield                     assert               else                 import               pass                 async                      await                break                except               in                   raise                Identifiers                Identifiers are the user-defined names of variables, lists, classes, functions, dictionaries, tuples, etc., which are               used to identify an element in Python.                Naming the identifiers follows rules as given below:                  • An identifier can have letters in uppercase or lowercase, numbers or underscore(_).                   • It can start with an alphabet or an underscore.                  • No special characters like $, period(.), space, etc. are allowed.                  • It should not be a Python keyword.                  • They are case sensitive. Uppercase and lowercase letters are different.                   • Identifiers can be of any length.               Some of the examples of valid identifiers are:  Num1, First_Name, Value, Scores_FirstTerm.                Some of the examples of invalid identifiers are: 1stsubject, My name, #mobile, City\&Code, and True.               Variables                 Variable is a name given to a memory location to hold a specific value. It is just like a container that can hold any               type of data that can be changed later in the program. Variable has:                  • A name that follows the rules of identifier naming conventions and is case sensitive.                   • A value that can be integer, float, string, boolean, etc.                     428     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","Unlike other programming languages, variables in Python are not created before.

It helps us to identify the kind of operation that can                  be performed on that specific data type. Every value in Python has a data type.                                                                  Data Types                                        Numbers          None          Boolean      Sequences      Sets     Maps                                    int      float     complex              string     list      tuple      Dictionary                   The description of these data types is as follows:                     • Numbers: Data with a numeric value fall into this category. It can be integer, float or complex. Python will                    automatically convert a number from one type to another if needed. Following are the number datatype.                        ✶ Integer: Integers are whole numbers (+ve, -ve or 0) with no fractions or decimal value. Range of an integer in                       Python can be from -2147483648 to 2147483647, and long integer has unlimited range subject to available                       memory. For example, 10, 124, –4567, 7812568751.                         ✶ Float: It is a real number with floating point representation. For example, 5.0, 15.5 or -12.7. It can also be                       represented using the exponent notation E. For example, 1E5 is 100000.                        ✶ Complex: It is made up of a real number and an imaginary number. For example, 3+2j where 3 is a real                       number, 2 is an imaginary number, and j is the imaginary unit.

It is                  represented by None.                  • Boolean: It is a data type with two built-in values: True or False. It is used in logical evaluation. A True value                  represents 1 while a False represents 0.

Each value is referred by its index number. It                  can be mutable or non-mutable. There are three types of data as sequence in Python:                     ✶ String: It is an ordered sequence of UNICODE characters enclosed in single or double quotes. Single-line                     strings can be created using either single quotes or double quotes. The quotes are not part of string. They                     only tell the computer where the string constant begins and ends. Its length is dependent on the available                     memory. It can also be empty where we have just empty quotes with no value.                [1]:   # Single-line                       \"    \"                   • A multiline string in Python is a string that spans across multiple lines. It allows you to create a string that                  contains line breaks and multiple paragraphs without using special characters like \\n for newline. Multiline                  strings are defined by enclosing the text within triple quotes, either single (''') or double (\"\"\") quotes.                 [1]:   # Multi-line String                       '''It is                       an interesting                       Language'''                     ✶ Lists: It is a sequence of heterogeneous values arranged as elements and are referred by an index number.                     These values are separated by comma and are enclosed in square brackets [ ]. They are mutable data types                     as the values of these data types can be changed by the user after creation.

These values are separated by comma and are enclosed in circular brackets ( ). They are immutable as the                     values of these data types cannot be changed by the user after creation.

Sets are defined using curly                  brackets {} with elements separated by commas. Each element in a set must be unique. Sets are commonly used                  for tasks that involve mathematical operations like union, intersection, and difference.

Each key is                       unique within the dictionary, and it maps to a corresponding value. Dictionary is represented by curly braces                       {} with each pair separated by a comma (,). Dictionaries are mutable, meaning they can be modified after                       their creation.

Assignment Operator                   Assignment operator is used to assign a value to a variable or a constant.

For example, 22/7*5.5 is an expression.               To evaluate an expression with multiple operators we follow an order of precedence in Python. This order can be               altered by writing an expression within parenthesis.                This order of precedence in the descending order is listed below:                                       Order of Precedence                 Operators                                                 1             ()                                                  2             **                                                 3             *, /, %, //                                                 4             +, -                                                  5             <=, <, >, >=, ==, !=                                                 6             =, %=, /=, //=, -=, +=, *=, **=                                                 7             not                                                 8             and                                                  9             or                In the above table, as you have seen that there are few operators with the same precedence then order of evaluation               is from left to right except for exponential (**) which is always from right to left.                      434     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","For example:                      • 2 + 5 * (15 - 10) // 2 will be evaluated as follows:                     2+5*(5)//2    since * and // have same precedence, it will be evaluated from left to right.                    2+12                    14                     • 25%3%2                     To evaluate the above expression it works like (25%3)%2.                     1%2= 1                     • 2**2**3                     This expression is evaluated from right to left.

Python supports two different types of type conversion.                   Implicit Type Conversion                   When the process of converting the value of one data type into another data type is done automatically without                  involving any action from the programmer is called Implicit Type conversion. Python always converts smaller                  data types to larger data types to avoid the loss of data.

It converts the expressions into a string               before writing to the screen. Syntax of the print() function is:                   print(object(s), sep=separator, end=end)                Where,                  • object can be one or more separated by comma and it can be a variable, literal or an expression.

When this statement executes then the flow of                  the program stops and waits with the cursor blinking for the user to enter a value.  The input given by the user                  is always accepted as a string value. In case a user enters an integer or float and we need this for mathematical                  calculation then we have to convert them explicitly to number data type by using int() or float(). Syntax for                  the input() function:                            input(prompt)                  Where prompt is optional.

The reason for the above is that by default the input statement always takes input as a string value. If a “+” is                  used with string, it concatenates the 2 string. In order to evaluate the expression mathematically, we must use                  int() with an input statement to convert it into integer. For example:                   [1]:   N1=int(input(\"Enter first number: \"))                         N2=int(input(\"Enter second number: \"))                         Sum = N1+N2                         print(\"Sum= \",Sum)                         Enter first number: 23                         Enter second number: 61                         Sum= 84                  Conditional Statements                    Conditional statements are used for selecting the block of statements to be executed based on the condition. We                  specify the condition in the program which evaluates to either True or False. If condition is True then the block                  of statements written for True will be executed and in case the condition is False then the block of statements                  for False will be executed. It is also called branching as a program decides which statement to execute based on                  the result of the evaluated condition. In Python:                     • A block is identified by using indentation (minimum 1 space). Ensure that all statements in one block are                    indented at the same level.                      • We use if to do conditional programming.

There are two types of                  looping statements in Python, let us study about them in detail.                  The for Loop                   The for loop is used to repeat a set of instructions for a fixed number of times. It means when the number of                  iterations is known/definite before we start with the execution of a loop. It is therefore also known as a definite                  loop. Indentation of statements is must to specify the block of statements to be repeated using for loop. Let                  us understand the flow of for loop with the help of a flowchart.                  There are commonly two different ways of using for loop.                  Using Sequence                  In this type of for loop, a sequence of values is used over which the loop iterate. The syntax to use the for loop                  with a sequence is:                       for <counter variable> in <sequence>:                             Statements                  Where,                     • for is a reserved keyword.                     • counter variable can be any identifier that keeps a count of the loop.                     • sequence can be any value like integer, string, list etc.                     • Statements always indented can be single or a block.

The syntax to use the for loop with a range() function is:                   for <Var> in range(<Start>,<End>,<Step>):                       <Statements>               Where,                  • for is a reserved keyword.                  • Start, end, step are parameters of range() function and will always be integers.                   • Start is a starting value of loop, End is an ending value (not inclusive) of loop, and Step is the number by which                  counter variable will be incremented or decremented. By default step value is 1.                  • If only one parameter is used the start becomes 0 and step becomes 1 as default.                  • If Start > End then Step = is a negative integer.                   • If Start < End then Step = is a positive integer.                  • If  Start  >=  End  and  Step  value  is  not  specified,  the  loop  will  not  execute  as  this  is  an  invalid  condition.

The While Loop                  The while loop is used to repeat a set of instructions as long as the condition is True. It means when the                  number of iterations is not fixed/indefinite before we start with the execution of a loop. It is therefore known as                  indefinite loop. Indentation of statements is must to specify the block of statements to be repeated using while                  loop. This loop is also called an entry-controlled loop as it checks for the condition in the beginning only. If the                  condition is True then the body of the loop will be executed. If the condition is False then it will not be allowed                  to enter within the loop and it stops.                  Syntax for the while loop:                      while <condition>:                          Statements                         increment or decrement counter variable                  Where,                      •  while  is a reserved keyword.                      •   condition  is the criterion to repeat the instructions. The instructions repeat till the condition is True.                         As soon as the condition is False it exits from the loop.                      •   Statements are always indented can be single or a block. They are repeated till the condition is True.                         Increment / decrement counter variable to change its value.

Modules and Packages                   A module is a Python file (.py) that contains Python code, including functions, classes, and variables, which can                  be reused in other programs. Modules help in structuring code efficiently by breaking it into manageable parts.                  A package is a collection of related Python modules organized within a directory. It typically includes an __init__.                  py file, which indicates that the directory should be treated as a package. Python provides numerous built-in and                  third-party packages to simplify coding tasks.

It                    enables image processing, video analysis, and object detection. It supports multiple programming languages                    and is extensively used in real-time applications, including facial recognition and augmented reality.                                                                                           Advance Python (Practical)  443","NumPy (Numerical Python)                NumPy is a powerful open-source scientific package that stands for 'Numerical Python'. It uses mathematical               and logical operations for handling large datasets through powerful data structure-n-dimensional arrays that               also speeds up data processing. NumPy is the first step in learning, to become a Python data scientist in the               future. Various other libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn are built on using some concepts of this               magical library. It can also be easily interfaced with other Python packages and provides tools for integrating               with other programming languages like C, C++ etc.               If you are using basic Python installed through https://www.python.org website then the NumPy package is not               included by default. You need to install it separately.               NumPy can be installed by typing following command:                                                           pip install NumPy               Once it is installed, it can be readily used in any Python code by using import keyword as shown below:               Numpy can also be imported into the Jupyter Notebook by using the given statement:                import numpy                               # this will import the complete numpy package               OR               import numpy as npy                        # this will import numpy and referred as npy               OR               from numpy import array                    #this will import ONLY arrays from whole numy package                OR               from numpy import array as ary     #this will import ONLY arrays and referred as ary                Arrays                 Arrays are an ordered collection of values of the same data type that can be arranged in one or more dimensions.               They can store numbers, characters, Boolean values, etc. The elements are referred to using index numbers               (positions) that start from 0. Almost all programming languages support arrays in one form or another.                   • A one-dimensional array is called a Vector.                  • A two-dimensional array is called a Matrix.                  • An array with multiple dimensions is called an n-dimensional array.               In NumPy, we can  create  n-dimensional arrays,  which are  considered  an  alternative  to Python  lists  because               they allow faster access to reading and writing elements efficiently. The NumPy library provides a large set of built-               in functions in the form of modules and packages for creating, manipulating, and transforming NumPy arrays.                NumPy Arrays vs Python Lists                The difference between NumPy Arrays vs Python Lists is shown in the below table:                 Feature              NumPy Array                               Python List                Data Type            Homogeneous (stores elements of the  Heterogeneous (can store elements of                                     same type)                                different types)                Data Type            Does not support mixed types within the  Supports mixed types and allows implicit                Conversion           same array                                conversion                Memory Efficiency    More memory-efficient                     Occupies more memory                       444     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","Feature              NumPy Array                              Python List                   Accessibility        Requires importing NumPy                 Built-in  Python  feature  (does  not  require                                                                                 an additional package)                   Mathematical         Supports  direct  mathematical  operations  Requires looping or applying operations to                   Operations           on all elements                          individual elements                   Usage                Mostly  used  for  scientific  computing,  Mainly used for data storage and                                        numerical operations, and data analysis  management                   Syntax               import numpy                             marks=[34,23,41,42]                                         marks=numpy.array([34,23,41,42])                   Creating an Array using NumPy                   Different ways to create an array using NumPy are as follows:                     • Creating one dimensional array:                      [1]:  import numpy                           rollno = numpy.array([1, 2, 3])                           print(rollno)                            [1 2 3]                     • Create a sequential 1 D array with values as multiples of 10 from 10 to 100:                      [1]:  import numpy as np                           a = np.arange(10,101,10)                           print(a)                           [ 10  20  30  40  50  60  70  80  90 100]                      • Creating one-dimensional array with 4 random values:                      [1]:  import numpy as np                           a = np.random.random(4)                           print(a)                           [0.4141628  0.1035279  0.05137008 0.98002355]                       • Creating two-dimensional array of 3 rows and 4 columns with random integer values less than 10:                      [1]:  import numpy as np                           a = np.random.randint(10, size=(3,4))                           print(a)                           [[3 1 4 1]                           [7 6 0 1]                           [4 2 2 9]]                      • Creating two-dimensional array of 3 rows and 4 columns with all ones as value:                       [1]:  import numpy as np                           a = np.ones((3,4))                           print(a)                           [[1. 1. 1. 1.]                            [1. 1. 1. 1.]                            [1. 1. 1. 1.]]                                                                                      Advance Python (Practical)  445","• Creating two-dimensional array of 3 rows and 3 columns with all zeroes as value:                    [1]:   import numpy as np                         a = np.zeros((3,3))                         print(a)                          [[0. 0. 0.]                          [0. 0. 0.]                          [0. 0. 0.]]                   • Creating two-dimensional array of 3 rows and 4 columns with all six as value:                   [1]:   import numpy as np                         a = np.full((3,4),6)                         print(a)                         [[6 6 6 6]                          [6 6 6 6]                          [6 6 6 6]]                   • We can create two-dimensional (2-D) arrays by passing nested lists to the array() function.

It provides strong features for                  working with three key data structures: Series (1-dimensional), DataFrame (2-dimensional), and Index (used for                  label-based indexing). These structures allow smooth processing and analysis of data, regardless of its origin. In                  Pandas, the data need not be labelled to be placed into a data structure.                  Pandas was created by Wes McKinney in 2008. The name \"Pandas\" is derived from Panel Data (a term in statistics                  for multidimensional data) and Python, as it was designed for data analysis in Python.                  Pandas is built on top of NumPy, so while you don't need to be an expert in NumPy to use Pandas, familiarity                  with NumPy can be helpful when performing operations on data.                                                                                            Advance Python (Practical)  449","Pandas is highly flexible, allowing you to work with:                   • Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, like in an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet.                  • Ordered and unordered time series data, which may not necessarily be of fixed frequency.                  • Arbitrary matrix data, either homogeneous or heterogeneous, with row and column labels.                  • A wide range of observational or statistical datasets.                Installing Pandas                 To install Pandas from command line, we need to type in:                                                           pip install pandas                 All libraries including NumPy and Pandas can be installed only when Python is already installed on that system.               Two commonly used data structures in Pandas are:                  • Series                   • DataFrames               Series                 Series is a one-dimensional array that can store data of any type like integer, string, float, python objects, etc.               We can also say that the Pandas series is just like a column of a spreadsheet.               The values can be referred to by using data axis labels also called index. Indexes are of two types: positional               index and labelled index. Positional indexes are integers starting with default 0 whereas labelled indexes are user               defined labels that can be of any datatype and can be used as an index.               Pandas Series can be created by loading the datasets from existing storage like SQL Database, CSV file, and Excel               file. Pandas Series can also be created from the lists, dictionary, and from any other scalar value.

Pandas offers several important features:                  • It provides a fast and efficient way to manage and explore data using Series and DataFrames, making it suitable                 for data science.                      456     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","• Missing data, represented as NaN (Not a Number), is easily and efficiently handled, regardless of data type.                     • Columns in DataFrames can be easily inserted, modified, or deleted.                      • Objects can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels or automatically handled by data structures for smooth                    processing and analysis.                      • Data organisation and labelling are effectively managed through intelligent slicing, alignment, and indexing                    methods.                     • It provides robust support for data cleaning needed for processing.                     • Pandas offers strong support for reshaping, merging, and joining datasets with great efficiency.                           Matplotlib                    Matplotlib was created by John D. Hunter in 2003. It is a free and open-source data visualisation library                  used  for plotting graphs and visualisation  in  Python.  Built  on NumPy arrays, it can be downloaded from                  https://matplotlib.org. With just a few lines of code, we can generate a wide range of plots, including line plots,                  histograms, bar charts, scatterplots, etc.                  Matplotlib comes with various plotting modules, but the most commonly used module is pyplot, which provides                  an easy interface for creating 2D plots and visualisations.                  Visuals have a significant impact on human cognition. The plots created using Matplotlib help us to understand                  trends, patterns, and correlations within data, presenting quantitative information in a visual form. After creating                  plots, you can customise their style, appearance, and make them more descriptive and communicative.                  Some types of graphs that we can make with this package are listed below:                                     Histogram            Pie Plot           Box Plot           Scatter Plot           Line Graph                   Installing Matplotlib                      • To install it using pip:                                                        python -m pip install -U pip                                                     python -m pip install -U matplotlib                    Or                                                           pip install matplotlib                     For plotting using Matplotlib, we need to import its Pyplot module as follows:                       import matplotlib.pyplot as plt                  The pyplot module of matplotlib has built in methods which help in designing a graph with all features. Few of                  the functions are explained below:                     • The plot(x,y,marker) function is used to create a box-like figure  where the actual graph is plotted.  To plot x axis                    versus y axis, we write plt.plot(x,y). By default, it plots a line graph.                                                                                        Advance Python (Practical)  457","• plt.plot(kind='line')will make a line graph. We can have the following values of the kind parameter to change the                 type of the graph needed to make.

Default is True. If you want grid on x-axis the the                 function will be: grid(axis = 'x')and for y axis grid(axis = 'y').                  • The xticks(values) function will mark the ticks/points on the x axis.                   • The yticks(values) function will mark the ticks/points on the y axis.               Markers               A marker is any symbol that represents a data value in a line chart or a scatter plot.

Linewidth is                  specified in pixels. The default line width is 1 pixel showing a thin line. Thus, a number greater than 1 will output                  a thicker line depending on the value provided. We can also set the line style of a line chart using the linestyle                  parameter. It can take a string such as \"solid\", \"dotted\", \"dashed\" or \"dashdot\".

It is generally used to compare values of two different               categories. Example: marks of 5 subjects to compare, rise in population in five years, changing fuel price every               month.                Various versions of bar charts exist like single bar chart, double bar chart, etc can be used.

It is used  for continuous data and the                  bars created show no gap in between. X-axis represents the bin ranges while Y-axis gives information about                  frequency.                   A histogram displays the numerical data grouped into bars also known as \"bins\" of equal size. The height of the                  bar represents the data point. Histogram helps you find the number of bars, the range of numbers that go into                  each bar, and the labels for the bar edges.                   Before you go for designing a Histogram you need to finalise the width of each bin. If we go from 10 to 250                  using bins with a width of 50 then the data can easily adjust in 5 bins. IT is always a good practice of using a                  decent number of bins in the designing of a histogram.

Statistical Learning with Python                   Now we all have understood that Data Sciences deals with data analysis and data manipulation. But this numeric                  \&  alpha-numeric  data  analysis and manipulation is  not possible  without  the  intervention  of  Mathematical                  Statistics.                  Python with supported libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib etc have a lot of pre-defined functions that implement                  Mathematical statistics without getting into the hassle of doing the calculations and creating the formulas or                  equations to find out the results. All we need to do is write that function and pass on the data to it. It’s that simple!                  Let us take a look at some basic statistical tools used in Python:                   Mean                    It is the average of numeric data in a given dataset. So, sum of all the values divided by the number of values in                  the given set.

OpenCV                    OpenCV stands for Open-Source Computer Vision Library, originally developed by Intel and officially launched                  in 1999. It is an open-source software library for computer vision and Machine Learning that helps a computer                  understand the content of digital images like photographs and videos.                  It helps in processing images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even handwriting. It supports a wide variety                  of programming languages like Python, C++, Java, etc. and is available on almost all platforms. We will use OpenCV                  for basic image processing operations on images such as resizing, cropping and many more.                  Let us first see how we can install it in our computer:                      • Open Anaconda  prompt and write the following command:                                                      pip install opencv-python                  Make sure you download the get-pip.py file and store it in the same directory as python is installed before you                  install OpenCV.                                  Brainy Fact                         Stanford’s robot “Stanley” used OpenCV and was declared the winner of the DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005.                       This challenge is a prize competition for American autonomous vehicles, funded by the Defense Advanced                       Research Projects Agency.                     The imread() Function in OpenCV                   The imread() function read the image and loads it into the computer’s memory. Syntax of imread() function                  is: cv2.imread(path, flag)                  Where,                   •    path is the path of the image to be read. If the file is in the working directory, then write only the name and the                    extension of the image otherwise it is a must to specify the complete path.                  •   flag is the way how our image should be read.

How to Write a Program in OpenCV                 Following are the steps to write a program in Open CV:                 Step 1   Importing the required libraries:                           •  We import cv2 to start with Computer Vision Application.                            •  We import matplotlib to display our images on the Jupyter Notebook.                           •  We import numpy to store the pixel values in the NumPy array.                  Step 2   Display a 2D image using the imread()function of cv2. Thus, the complete code that appears in                           Jupyter Notebook will be:                   [1]:   import cv2 # import OpenCV                         from matplotlib import pyplot as plt # import matplotlib                         import numpy as np # import numpy                         img = cv2.imread('D:/Flower.jpg')                         plt.imshow(img)                         plt.title('Flowers') #Display this title on the top of the image                         plt.axis('off')                         plt.show()                                  Did you notice that the colour of the image above is not presented properly? This is because OpenCV represents               the images in BGR (Blue Green Red) combination instead of RGB (Red Green Blue) so the blue color in images               dominates. We will use the following code in imshow()function for converting from BGR to RGB:                plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))               So, the new code with the new display will be:                   [1]:   import cv2 # import OpenCV                         from matplotlib import pyplot as plt # import matplotlib                         import numpy as np # import numpy                         img = cv2.imread('D:/Flower.jpg')                         plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))                         plt.title('Flowers') #Display this title on the top of the image                         plt.axis('off')                         plt.show()                      472     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-X","To print the image in grayscale the change in imshow() function will be using cmap parameter:                  img = cv2.imread('D:/Flower.jpg',0) #Load the image file with 0 parameter                                             #To open in grayscale mode                   plt.imshow(img, cmap = 'gray') #cmap=gray specifies color mapping as gray                     [1]:  import cv2 # import OpenCV                           from matplotlib import pyplot as plt # import matplotlib                           import numpy as np # import numpy                           img = cv2.imread('D:/Flower.jpg',0) #Load the image file with 0 parameter                           #To open in grayscale mode                           plt.imshow(img, cmap = 'gray') #cmap=gray specifies color mapping as gray                           plt.title('Flowers') #Display this title on the top of the image                           plt.axis('off')                           plt.show()                                     Image Processing Operations                   Let us learn about some of the functions we can perform over images.

A box plot which is also known as a whisker plot displays a summary of a set of data containing the minimum, first                        quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.                      25.  What are outlier data and which graph is best to plot it using matplotlib?                    Ans.  Outliers are extreme observations in the dataset. So a rule to determine if a data point is extreme is to compare                        it against the interquartile range. The best graph to visualize outliers in a dataset using matplotlib is the box plot                        (also known as a box-and-whisker plot). The box plot is specifically designed to show the distribution of data and                        highlight outliers.                     26.  How does NumPy handle multidimensional arrays?                    Ans.
